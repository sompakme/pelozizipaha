Just one look at her and it's easy to see what all the hype is about. With her platinum blonde locks of hair and fair skin, comparisons to Marilyn Monroe are as predictable as they are understandable. But perhaps a better comparison would be Jennifer Aniston. Both actresses enjoyed incredible success early on in their careers, landing lead roles in incredibly popular TV shows. In the case of Jennifer Aniston, she went on to enjoy lasting success after that show had ended. Many of her cast mates from&nbsp;Friends cannot say the same.</p><p>Dove Cameron is most likely hoping she can pull off the same feat. As she moves out of the safety net of the Disney channel, she will put every single one of her skills to the test as she tries to establish herself in the competitive world of Hollywood. Our prediction? She will be every bit as successful as Jennifer Aniston. She's certainly got everything she needs to accomplish that goal. She's gorgeous, she's talented, and she's incredibly determined and driven, to name but a few of her traits. Here's why we think Dove Cameron will be the next Jennifer Aniston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-been-involved-in-theater-and-acting-since-the-age-of-8><strong>She Has Been Involved In Theater And Acting Since The Age Of 8</strong></h2><p>Like so many talented actors today, Dove Cameron has been at it a very long time indeed. So many of the best celebrities today got their start as child stars, and Dove Cameron also has ample experience in the world of acting from an extremely young age. She was heavily involved in high level theater from the age of just eight. The fact that she's had all that experience makes it clear that Dove Cameron has everything she needs to make it big in the coming years.</p><h2 id=she-s-multi-talented><strong>She's Multi-Talented</strong></h2><p>Not only has she been acting from a young age, but she's also been doing... well,&nbsp;everything. This young actress is multi-talented in the truest sense of the word, and she brings so much to the table as a performer. She's a talented singer with a new album on the way. She's performed on stage in productions which demand strong dance skills. And of course she is an incredibly talented actor with tons of credits under her belt. All of these skills come together to form a celebrity with incredible potential going forward.</p><h2 id=she-seems-to-have-graduated-from-disney><strong>She Seems To Have "Graduated" From Disney</strong></h2><p>Like many stars we know and love, Dove Cameron got her start in the world of Disney. Appearing in shows such as&nbsp;Liv And Maddie, and also the&nbsp;Descendants&nbsp;film series, Dove Cameron has made a name for herself as one of Disney's brightest young talents. But one of the fears for many of these Disney stars is they never truly move past the confines of Disney, onto bigger and more mature roles. Dove Cameron does not suffer from this problem, as she's already starting to "graduate" from the Disney universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-already-starred-alongside-jennifer-aniston><strong>She's Already Starred Alongside Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p>Speaking of moving on to bigger and better things, Dove Cameron has already booked an incredibly interesting role in an upcoming movie. And funnily enough, this movie will star Jennifer Aniston! This movie is called&nbsp;Dumplin, and it will undoubtedly prove to be a defining role for Dove Cameron. In addition, being on set with Jennifer Aniston will probably be a great learning experience for the young actress. Is Dove going to be the next Jennifer Aniston? Well, the fact that she's starring in movies alongside Aniston is a pretty good sign!</p><h2 id=she-is-confident-in-her-own-body><strong>She Is Confident In Her Own Body</strong></h2><p>Dove Cameron represents a new breed of celebrities who aren't shy about their bodies. They're confident in their own skin, and Dove Cameron is one of the most outspoken on accepting your own physicality. She's just one of many celebrities who are really setting a positive example in this regard. She was quoted by&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;as saying:&nbsp;"People are gross, your [body] and how you choose to use it is YOUR decision, not theirs to be forced on you." This shows that Dove Cameron has the maturity and confidence to make it big.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-love-life-is-stable-and-not-a-distraction><strong>Her Love Life Is Stable, And Not A Distraction</strong></h2><p>Too often, we see talented and gifted celebrities get distracted by the ups and downs of their personal lives. Romances can cause a real effect on a person's career. But Dove Cameron's love life seems incredibly stable with Thomas Doherty. She's even suggested they might get married. She was also quoted by that same&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;article as tweeting:&nbsp;"My boyfriend is my ultimate crush."</p><h2 id=she-sang-the-theme-song-for-a-marvel-series><strong>She Sang The Theme Song For A Marvel Series</strong></h2><p>We spoke before about Dove Cameron being multi-talented, and this really proves it. Not only did they ask Dove Cameron to be a voice actor in the Marvel's new animated series&nbsp;Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors, they also asked her to sing the theme song! The song is called "Born Ready," and it really showcases Dove Cameron's amazing voice. The fact that she's such a huge presence in this show really proves that she's a force to be reckoned with. We hope to hear a lot more of her voice in the future!</p><h2 id=she-struggled-with-body-image-issues-and-got-through-it><strong>She&nbsp;Struggled With Body Image Issues And Got Through It</strong></h2><p>The mark of a true inspiration is someone who has overcome great hardship. And as it turns out, Dove has been down some pretty difficult paths. Dove Cameron was quoted by <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>&nbsp;as saying:&nbsp;"I've never said this before, but I had such a bad case of [a body disorder]. I was so badly down that hole [...] But it was because I thought I needed to be absolutely tiny to be loved. I genuinely thought I needed to be as skinny as I possibly could to be loved and appreciated and good enough."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-also-a-talented-voice-actor><strong>She's Also A Talented Voice Actor</strong></h2><p>We've already mentioned the fact that Dove Cameron has been involved in voice acting for some time, but it's hard to stress how intelligent of a career decision this is. Getting herself established early on in her career as a voice actor is very clever, because she's making sure that she'll always have acting work. Let's face it, people don't stay pretty forever – but Dove Cameron will now always have a career as a voice actor. It might not be as noticeable or as glamorous, but it's one of the most lucrative parts of the acting industry. She has provided the voice for Gwen Stacy, Ghost Spider, as well as voice acting in the upcoming&nbsp;Angry Birds&nbsp;movie.</p><h2 id=she-has-some-wise-words-for-her-fans><strong>She Has Some Wise Words For Her Fans</strong></h2><p>A celebrity can also be judged by how they interact with their fans. Dove Cameron has some of the most zealous fans in the entire world, and she's said some interesting things to them in the past. Some would say they're harsh words, but others have commended her for how "real" she got with a certain fan. This fan said on social media that her life goal was to get Dove Cameron to notice her. As quoted by&nbsp;<a href=#>ET Canada</a>, Dove replied, saying:&nbsp; “That is a very small and unimportant life goal. Maybe if I notice you, you will realize how unfulfilling that is and turn your phone off because celebrities don’t matter. Go find yourself in nature and create your own life philosophy. Aim higher, babe.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-rejects-the-world-of-social-media><strong>She Rejects The World Of Social Media</strong></h2><p>Speaking of social media, Dove Cameron totally recognizes how fake it all is.&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;quoted her as saying:</p><p>"I really hate how Instagram makes me feel, I think, and I hate how Twitter and any kind of social media makes me feel. Whether I'm looking at other people's lives or how I portray my life, I just hate the whole thing. I hate it. I think that they're something super wrong with staring at other people that much and I think there's something really wrong with staring at yourself that much. It's like walking around with a mirror up to yourself all day long. You don't even look at people's eyes. You look at how you come off to them, like you're watching yourself in a dream." Wise words from someone who clearly understands what it means to be famous.</p><h2 id=she-has-great-tactics-for-dealing-with-anxiety><strong>She Has Great Tactics For Dealing With Anxiety</strong></h2><p>Speaking of the pressures of being famous, Dove Cameron isn't immune to the stress it can cause for the average person. She's only human, and she has admitted to dealing with anxiety in the past. What's impressive is that she's started to develop tactics to deal with her anxiety.&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;quoted her as saying:&nbsp;"I finally caved and started meditating. After 1 million people told me to start and I have to say, it does make a huge difference in my anxiety. I thought it would be the opposite, but after a few times, you start to notice its effects. I 100% recommend." If she takes her mental health this seriously, she's going to go far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-knows-how-to-be-herself><strong>She Knows How To Be Herself</strong></h2><p>Part of good acting is knowing how to be yourself. This lesson actually comes in handy with everyday life, as well. And Dove Cameron really understands the strength of accepting yourself for who you are. She was quoted by&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;as saying: "No one is 'perfect' and we should not strive to be 'cured,' but rather, embrace highs and lows as a fact and center piece of being alive. 'This moment is inevitable.' There is no one, and nowhere you should strive to be except EXACTLY who and where you are."</p><h2 id=she-s-already-won-an-emmy><strong>She's Already Won An Emmy</strong></h2><p>Dove Cameron is certainly making waves, and a big sign that she's destined for future success comes from the awards she's been given. Without a doubt, the most prestigious award she has received is an Emmy, and that was awarded to her this year. The 22-year-old won the Emmy for&nbsp;Outstanding Performer in a Children's Preschool Children's or Educational and Informative Program. She won the award for&nbsp;Liv And Maddie: Cali Style. This kind of publicity and recognition is a great sign for her future endeavors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-inspiration-is-female-empowerment><strong>Her Inspiration Is Female Empowerment</strong></h2><p>When she accepted that Emmy, Dove Cameron gave an exceptional speech, thanking all those who had helped her along the way and acknowledging the importance of female empowerment. As quoted by&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>, she stated during the speech:&nbsp;"Empowering young women and sending a positive message, which is what this is all about. It's the reason why I got started in this industry, and I couldn't be prouder of what we've created on this show." With that mindset, this young star will be able to accomplish anything she puts her mind to.</p><h2 id=she-said-that-being-a-celebrity-is-just-another-job><strong>She Said That Being A Celebrity Is Just Another Job</strong></h2><p>One thing about Dove Cameron is that she's&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;down to Earth and self-aware, especially for someone of her age. In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Flaunt</a>, she recognized the absurdity of worshiping celebrities, saying: "It’s so weird because being a celebrity is no different than having any other job, except we’ve decided as a society that it is. Nobody is higher than anybody else, so what a strange thing to feed into.” If she keeps that sense of levelheadedness, she'll do just fine in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-only-wants-to-do-big-projects-from-now-on><strong>She Only Wants To Do Big Projects From Now On</strong></h2><p>How do we know Dove Cameron is going to be the next Jennifer Aniston? She's got big dreams. In fact, she's stated that she only wants to do big projects right now. She won't be satisfied with roles that don't meet her standards, or things that don't push her out of her comfort zone.</p><p>In that interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Flaunt</a>, Dove stated:&nbsp;“I don’t want to do anything unless it’s extremely authentic [...] I don’t ever want to do anything just to stay busy or have a press release. I have to fight that fear lizard-brain that tells me to just do what people expect of me. It’s a weird, scary thing to live by your reward system alone, but I think it’s one of those things that eventually pays off and creates a much richer life.”</p><h2 id=she-s-been-dramatic-since-she-was-a-small-child><strong>She's Been Dramatic Since She Was A Small Child</strong></h2><p>In that same interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Flaunt</a>, she admitted she's always had a flair for the dramatic, saying: "I’ve always been the most extra. When I was seven, I wore red lipstick everyday and big fur collars. I was not a smiley kid. I was broody and dramatic. My mom always tells this story about how I only liked to drink out of wine glasses. I would walk into the room with my wine glass and sigh really loudly. She’d be like, ‘What?’ and I’d say, ‘I’m just so tired. I’m so, so tired.’ Seven years old and so jaded. I’ve always been a theater kid. Aside from getting a little taller, I haven’t really changed at all.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-over-20-million-followers-on-instagram><strong>She Has Over 20 Million Followers On Instagram</strong></h2><p>Another reason why she's an actress that needs to be taken seriously is the fact that she has a huge following. Her fans are seriously obsessed with her, and with a following of over 20 million on Instagram alone, it's fair to say that she has an army of fans. Her Instagram is also a great way to keep up with what she's doing in her personal life, but what this really shows is that the people love her. She is simply adored by people all over the globe, and so any movie or show she appears in will be almost guaranteed success.</p><h2 id=she-s-beautiful><strong>She's Beautiful</strong></h2><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure this one out. Yes, Dove Cameron is, without a doubt gorgeous. It's difficult not to stress this point enough. Looking at her almost makes us question our very eyes. She looks exactly what you would expect a Disney princess to look like, if she ever escaped from the cartoon world and entered reality. Her beauty definitely isn't the only thing she's got going for her, but it definitely doesn't hurt. We're sure that this is one feature that will help her immensely in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>eonline.com</a>, <a href=#>teenvogue.com</a>, <a href=#>etcanada.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>teenvogue.com</a>, <a href=#>flaunt.com</a>, <a href=#>kitsapsun.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6s7HArKanq12stbp5w6itnmWTlrqmvs6nZLChnKF6o7GMrZ%2BeZZ6axG62xKelop6Vp3qiusisq6imXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./evander-holyfield-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Evander Holyfield Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
