She appeared to mourn her late husband, René Angélil, for a long time, even revealing that <a href=#>she wasn't sure she ever wanted to pursue romance</a> again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond that, fans began to notice that the perpetually petite singer <a href=#>seemed even thinner than usual</a>, though she repeatedly pushed back against gossip about her thinness and physical wellbeing. In fact, Céline maintains an impressively rigorous fitness regimen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Celine Dion Does To Stay In Shape</a></span></p><p>But when Céline recently postponed her Las Vegas show for health reasons, social media exploded with concern for the songstress. After so many years of speculation, it turned out there was, ultimately, something to be concerned about with regard to the singer's wellbeing.</p><p>Here's what we now know about her health, thanks to information straight from Céline herself.</p><h2 id=c-eacute-line-cited-an-unexpected-medical-issue>Céline Cited An Unexpected Medical Issue</h2><p>Though fans have always worried over Céline's slim figure, that's not necessarily related to her recently revealed health troubles. Her <a href=#>recent show cancelation</a> was due to muscle spasms, a condition that no fan could have predicted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Céline herself was devastated to disappoint her fans, though many of them flocked to her Instagram to support her, no matter how long it takes her to return to the stage.</p><p>Still, it must be frustrating for Céline to encounter a medical concern after so many years of defending herself against rumors about her health. This isn't the first time people have suggested Céline was ill, though it is the first time she's ever spoken up and admitted a health condition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-thought-c-eacute-line-was-seriously-ill>Fans Thought Céline Was Seriously Ill</h2><p>In the past, baseless rumors about Céline Dion's health led fans to believe she had an array of health conditions. Some were centered on how thin she was, despite her impressive physical strength, as exhibited by not just her ballet expertise but her overall physicality on stage (those high notes take a lot of energy and stamina!).</p><p>Then, an even sadder rumor started; that <a href=#>Céline was suffering from some incurable disease</a>. That rumor stemmed from the fact that Céline's mother had an eye condition, even though it was quite a leap to suggest that Dion had a similar issue.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Celine Dion Transformed Her Body</a></span></p><p>After all that speculation, the sum-up was that Dion wasn't ill, the rumors were just rumors and tabloid fodder. In fact, by all accounts, she was just fine and planning a comeback of sorts with her new Las Vegas show. No one could find any shred of evidence that things weren't 100 percent fine with Dion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, things seemed to take a serious turn.</p><h2 id=what-health-condition-does-c-eacute-line-dion-have>What Health Condition Does Céline Dion Have?</h2><p>Officially, Céline Dion has not revealed what condition she has, if any. Thus far, her team has only released the detail that she has had "unforeseen medical symptoms," specifically "severe and persistent muscle spasms" that prevented her from performing.</p><p>The statement highlighted that the songstress was "heartbroken" by the setback, as she had been planning and looking forward to her show for months.</p><p>Dion's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> specified that she was looking forward to getting better and coming back to delight her fans once more, but that was it in the way of details. So of course, fans began speculating over what could possibly be 'wrong' with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Céline Dion's Husband Given A Pass For The Same Behavior As R. Kelly?</a></span></p><p>There was no indication of whether her muscle spasms were painful or not, so it's nearly impossible for fans to start their Google diagnosis of the starlet. There's also the fact that some muscle spasms can be fleeting, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on</a> things like a lack of electrolytes, dehydration, stress, too much high-intensity exercise, and even a lack of sufficient stretching, notes Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>Other potential causes include a restriction in blood flow, sitting for too long or the wrong way, and generalized issues like "overusing the muscles" or standing on concrete floors.</p><h2 id=is-c-eacute-line-dion-really-sick>Is Céline Dion Really Sick?</h2><p>However, it's worth noting that Céline canceled not just one or two shows, but a full set of 21 appearances. To fans, that seems to indicate that there's a larger issue at play than simple dehydration or a bout with intense stress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without confirmation from the singer, of course, fans and tabloids can only speculate. At the same time, given Céline's status and her impressive level of wealth, she'll clearly have the best treatment available, whether she needs some electrolytes or more serious treatment for whatever ails her.</p><p>Fans just hope that she feels better soon, that nothing is seriously wrong with her, and that she'll quickly get back to doing what she loves.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Celine Dion Surprises Fans With What Her Natural Hair Actually Looks Like</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqWfp8BurcGorK1lk5q5qrrEZpuip56oeqmxwKWroWWnna61edaeZKSmn6x8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carrie-fisher-regretted-opening-up-about-harrison-ford-affair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carrie Fisher Regretted Opening Up About Harrison Ford Affair">&larr;
