The singer hasn't gone out on the road since his 2018 Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour. Thanks to <a href=#>Drake's many famous relationships</a>, it seems like he is always in the news. This time, the focus is on his live performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every time Drake tours, he definitely adds to his net worth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has $250 million. So it's safe to say that he's raking it in with every single concert. How much money did Drake make from his 2023 tour? And why is there a class-action lawsuit against him?</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-drake-make-from-his-2023-tour>How Much Money Did Drake Make From His 2023 Tour?</h2><p>Since Drake's 2023 tour includes 29 dates, it's possible that he has made a great profit. And as seems to be the case these days, the tickets aren't cheap. This definitely makes sense given Drake's high profile. And although <a href=#>the singer tried to hide who he is</a>, he's always going to be a major star who grabs attention everywhere that he goes.</p><p>The first night of the tour will be in New Orleans in June. After that, the singer will travel to Memphis, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Montreal, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and more. He will also play two concerts at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto in October 2023. Ticket prices do vary depending on the venue. But it's fair to say that Drake is doing well as a result of the tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/drake.jpg><p>According to Seathub.com, tickets for Drake's Toronto shows will cost fans several hundred dollars. The cheapest tickets start at $356. The most expensive tickets are almost $2,000.</p><p>If fans want to see Drake in Memphis, they can find a ticket for $156. That is a little more reasonable. But it still might not be in everyone's budget.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Michael B.

However, fans can guess what he will earn based on his 2018 tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake's Aubrey And The Migos Tour made $79 million</a>, according to Forbes. Fans purchased 678,410 tickets and Drake performed in 43 cities. When Drake toured in 2016, he went to 54 cities and made $84 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Drake.jpg><p>Forbes reported that several other artists made more money from their tours than Drake did. Beyoncé and Jay Z's tour earned $254 million, Taylor Swift's earned $345 million, and Ed Sheeran's earned $432 million. Still, $79 million is a lot of money.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Drake Is An Executive Producer Of Euphoria, But Does He Actually Do Anything?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Drake last toured in 2018, he has continued to record albums. In September 2021, his album "Certified Loverboy" came out. And "Honestly, Nevermind" came out in June 2022. Fans loved the songs "Massive" and "Sticky from Drake's most recent album and it will be fun to hear him play these tunes live.</p><p>In a 2023 interview with Yachty that fans can see on YouTube, Drake talked about the future of his music career. He talked about how it can be easy to fall into the "competition" of this kind of career. And it sounds like he doesn't want to compete anymore.</p><p>Drake said, “what’s left for me is just to find a way to gracefully continue making projects that are extremely interesting, and hopefully cherished by people, and then to find the right time to say 'I can’t wait to see what the next generation does.' I will still be around to work with people or do a show here or there, but I’m not going to force myself to compete.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Drake is going on tour in the summer and fall months of 2023, it seems that performing is still part of his plan.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-class-action-lawsuit-that-was-filed-against-drake>What Is The Class-Action Lawsuit That Was Filed Against Drake?</h2><p>Although many fans were thrilled to buy tickets to Drake's 2023 tour, not everyone was pleased. There is currently a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">class-action lawsuit against Drake</a>. According to NME.com, LPC Avocat Inc. is representing a fan from Montreal, Quebec.</p><p>The Toronto Star reported on the lawsuit, which is about Ticketmaster selling expensive Drake concert tickets. LPC Avocat Inc. wrote, “Ticketmaster unilaterally decides which tickets it advertises and sells as ‘official platinum’ based on a given event."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/drake.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lawsuit continued, "The result is that most, if not all, of the tickets advertised and sold as ‘official platinum’ are neither ‘premium tickets’ nor ‘some of the best seats in the house’ and are, in fact, just regular tickets sold by Ticketmaster at an artificially inflated premium in bad faith.”</p><p>It's definitely upsetting to buy expensive tickets... and then learn that the seats are super high up. It's also upsetting to spend a lot of money on tickets and then find out that it was possible to get a deal. And that is exactly what happened to one fan.</p><p>The Star reported that when the fan purchased two Drake tickets, they spent $789.54 per ticket. They were called "official platinum." The fan said that a day later, the tickets were several hundred dollars cheaper.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Drake Shelled Out Millions Of Dollars In Order To Keep Being A Terrible Celebrity Neighbor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2023, the lawyer working on the class-action lawsuit, Joey Zukran, was interviewed by Toronto Life. He talked about whether musicians actually want ticket prices to be this high.</p><p>Zukran said, "I want to be very careful what I say—obviously I don’t want to get sued by Drake. Do I suspect that the artist gets a percentage of sales and that they would have an interest in the tickets selling for as much as possible? Yes, but I don’t know for certain. That is something we will find out as the case continues."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/drake-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zukran also told Toronto Life, "When we launched the class action, we tweeted about it and tagged Drake, but so far he hasn’t said a word, which is disappointing, especially when you look at recent comparable examples with prominent artists."</p><p>Zukran mentioned that when Taylor Swift fans were upset about Ticketmaster selling high ticket prices, Swift did talk about it. She was honest about how problematic she thought this trend was. Drake, however, doesn't appear to have spoken about the subject.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmb%2Bit8RmpJqjlWK6sLrEsmSfqp%2Bieqm10mZpaWpjYsGwwdFmmGabnJbAtHnAnKuip55iuaLD0q6grWWjmK6vsMClZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-katy-perry-spends-her-millions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Katy Perry Spends Her Millions">&larr;
