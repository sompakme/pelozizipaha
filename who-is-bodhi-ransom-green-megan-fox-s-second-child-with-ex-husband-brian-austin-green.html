Bodhi Ransom Green is no exception, he is the second son of celebrity parents Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green. Although his parents are not together anymore, people are still curious about his whereabouts and other life updates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bodhi Ransom Green’s name pays homage to Megan Fox’s religion who follows Buddhism. The word ‘bodhi’ means awakened or enlightened, which has its roots in the Buddhist ideal of a deeper understanding of the world. Bodhi Ransom Green looks like a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mini version of his mom</a>, Megan Fox, but fans rarely see pictures of him as the actress prefers to keep her children out of the spotlight.</p><h2 id=where-is-bodhi-ransom-green-now>Where Is Bodhi Ransom Green Now?</h2><p>The couple Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green welcomed their second son Bodhi Ransom Green on February 12, 2014, at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. Bodhi has an older brother Noah Shanon Green who was born in September 2012 and a younger brother Journey River Green who was born in August 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/megan-fox-at-the-premiere-of-good-mourning-in-la.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bodhi Ransom Green has a half-brother named Kassius, born in March 2002, from his dad’s first partner Vanessa Marcil. His grandparents are Franklin Thomas Fox, Gloria Darlene Fox, Joyce Green, and George Green.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Is Megan Fox's Relationship Like With Her Kids?</a></span></p><p>Bodhi Ransom Green was first introduced to the world when Megan Fox came as a guest on ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ in May 2014. Megan Fox revealed that she became pregnant with Bodhi while filming the action movie ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’. Bodhi’s education and personal details have been kept private so that he can have a normal childhood away from the scrutiny of the media.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">marriedbiography.org</a>, it is reported that Bodhi Ransom Green is an energetic child who relishes running and exploring his surroundings, as well as spending time outside playing with friends at the park.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-5-4.jpg><p>In 2020, Bodhi Ransom Green’s parents filed for a divorce, then his mother, Megan Fox, sought joint custody of the children. In the end, she and her former husband came to terms and accepted joint custody.</p><p>The high-profile divorce proceedings and public prominence of Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green subjected their son, Bodhi Ransom Green, to intense media views. Whenever Bodhi's mother is seen in public with his siblings, the paparazzi would swarm them in an attempt to capture pictures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-bodhi-ransom-green-39-s-childhood-like>What Was Bodhi Ransom Green's Childhood Like?</h2><p>Although his parents have tried to shield him from the media from a tender age, he is already known for his successful parents. Growing up, Bodhi Ransom Green has been greatly impacted by the persistent intrusion of media and paparazzi that consistently hounds his parents. This has elicited a strong reaction from both Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green, who have expressed their dissatisfaction with the violation of their children's privacy.</p><p>Despite their efforts, Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green still faced criticism for <a href=# rel=nofollow>their parenting style</a>. Back in 2018, they received backlash from several individuals for allowing their sons to have long hair, leading some people to mistake them for girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Megan-Fox-Was-Told-By-Hollywood-Not-To-Watch-Herself-In-Jonah-Hex_-But-TikTokers-Gave-Her-The-Courage-To-Do-Otherwise.jpg><p>However, Megan Fox is firm in her belief that her parenting approach allows Bodhi Ransom Green and his brothers to express themselves through their attire and appearance. Noah, Bodhi’s older brother, has a preference for wearing his hair long and wearing dresses, because of this, Noah was bullied and made fun of at his school.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Everything We Know About Megan Fox's Kids</a></span></p><p>According to Bodhi’s father, different opinions should be respected and no one’s view should be considered superior. Both Bodhi’s parents aspire to raise their children to be unencumbered by societal expectations and have the freedom to express themselves. Bodhi Ransom Green’s mother even stated that she cannot control the way other people react to her children, which is why she chooses not to put them on her social media very often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-do-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-co-parent-bodhi-ransom-green>How Do Megan Fox And Brian Austin Green Co-Parent Bodhi Ransom Green?</h2><p>Bodhi Ransom Green’s parents still kept making headlines for their personal affairs.

Megan Fox also revealed that she often breaks down and cries when she's separated from her boys and how she struggles to cope with being away from them when she's traveling for work.</p><p>Brian Austin Green shared his feelings about making mistakes when it comes to co-parenting. He said that going into separation is a mistake in itself and everyone should consider the children and the stress that the parents are going to put them through during the separation process.
