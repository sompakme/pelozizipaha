When you think about it, there is pretty much no downside at all, as long as you have the maturity to handle &nbsp;it. And that is the thing, it is not easy. Even some adult stars have a hard time not having all the fame and money go to their heads. So what about their kids? Do you think having unlimited money and having their parents be huge stars might possibly be something difficult to handle?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, maybe not for all of them, but it certainly was for the people on this list. All of them have been in serious trouble, either with the law or with drugs and alcohol, and quite often both. And why wouldn't they? They had money and power right from the jump, and many of them were raised by nannies while their parents were away on a set somewhere. The combination of having no boundaries, while also desperately seeking attention to make a name for themselves on their own has led a lot of these bratty kids into some deep trouble.</p><p>Sometimes they are around lots of partying, drugs, and booze when they are really young. Or maybe their parents are not around enough, or don't model healthy behavior. Or quite possibly they are just total brats who don't care how miserable their behavior makes their parents, or anyone else for that matter. Here are 15 bratty kids that keep dragging their Hollywood parents down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-redmond-o-neal-ryan-o-neal-and-farrah-fawcett><strong>15. Redmond O'Neal-Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett</strong></h2><p>Back in the day <a href=#>Ryan O'Neal</a> and <a href=#>Farrah Fawcett</a> were one of the biggest couples in Hollywood- both were huge stars and at one point Farrah was considered one of the hottest women in the world. By all accounts they were not the best parents though; there were a lot of drugs and infidelity involved, their marriage fell apart in a very public way, and one of Ryan's sons even said he <a href=#>gave him some cocaine</a> when he was 11. So of course their son Redmond turned out great, right? Not so much... He was arrested in 2011 on firearms and heroin charges, and was then convicted. He got off relatively light, but then kept messing up on probation and ended up serving three years. He was released in September.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-cyrus-zachariah-cybill-shepherd><strong>14.&nbsp;Cyrus Zachariah-Cybill Shepherd</strong></h2><p>Everyone used to love <a href=#>Cybill Shepherd</a>. &nbsp;She was gorgeous and was best known for her role in&nbsp;Moonlighting,&nbsp;in which she starred opposite <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, which pretty much launched his career. She also apparently raised a total brat. Her son Cyrus Zachariah was arrested back in 2010 for stealing some cash and a camera from the carry-on luggage of some fellow passengers on a plane. According to reports,&nbsp;"A camera belonging to one of the victims, a fellow UPenn student, was found on Cyrus' seat and the rest of her missing items were found in a trash can in one of the plane's lavatories, police said." He was ordered by the court to get alcohol counseling. Probably not a bad idea- being drunk and stealing out of people's luggage is no way to show off how rich and famous you are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-stephanie-bongiovi-jon-bon-jovi><strong>13. Stephanie Bongiovi-Jon Bon Jovi</strong></h2><p>Everyone loves&nbsp;<a href=#>Jon Bon Jovi</a>. Even if you pretend that you don't, come on- it is Jon Bon Jovi for crying out loud! He was one of the biggest rock stars of his generation and was adored by tons of female fans. That is cool and all, but imagine calling him dad. If it seems like it could be a lot of pressure, well it was for &nbsp;his daughter, Stephanie, who was found unresponsive in her dorm room at New York's Hamilton College after overdosing on heroin. Come on, who goes to an expensive liberal arts college and shoots up heroin in her dorm room? Well, probably the daughter of a rich famous rock star, I suppose. She made a full recovery and by all accounts seems to be clean now and doing okay, and we hope that continues.</p><h2 id=12-montana-fishburne-laurence-fishburne><strong>12. Montana Fishburne-Laurence Fishburne</strong></h2><p>This is a good one. Well, it is a good one for us, but not for <a href=#>Laurence Fishburne</a>. &nbsp;The star of many movies, including&nbsp;Boyz in the Hood&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Matrix. Well, it seems that she did an adult film a few years ago, and Laurence flipped out just a tad. He tried to buy all of the videos so no one could see them and according to <a href=#>this</a>: "His friends pitched in and tried to buy up all of Montana’s porn videos for $1 million before anyone else had the chance to, but it was too late the DVDs were already shipped out to stores.&nbsp;Montana Fishburne eventually faked a suicide attempt to scare her father." Boy she sounds like a real gem! &nbsp;That Laurence sure is a lucky dad. There is no doubt that Monica is hot; too bad she made so many bad decisions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-nick-hogan-hulk-hogan><strong>11. Nick Hogan-Hulk Hogan</strong></h2><p>Speaking of bad decisions, let's move on to <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> and his son Nick. First of all, let's be honest, being the son of Hulk Hogan must be awful. I am not even going to explain all the reasons why, because that would be more like a book, not an entry in a list article. Nick &nbsp;crashed his car while drinking and a passenger in the car got a brain injury. &nbsp;In 2007, he was charged with reckless driving involving serious bodily injury, use of a motor vehicle in commission of a felony, and a person under the age of 21 operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or higher, and ended up serving eight months in jail. He had also been involved in other car accidents where he had been driving irresponsibly earlier in life. Nick, grow up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-marston-hefner-hugh-hefner><strong>10. Marston Hefner-Hugh Hefner</strong></h2><p>Being the son of <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a>, man that must be fun, right? Who would not want to see their dad soused on booze and cavorting with tons of naked women all the time. You think that might possibly give one a few issues about how to relate to women? Well, apparently it did with his son Marston, who was arrested for beating his girlfriend Claire Sinclair, who was a Playmate of course. He ended up being &nbsp;sentenced to a 52-week domestic violence program and also was ordered to have&nbsp;no contact with her. Marston's mother is Kimberly Conrad, who is ridiculously hot and was married to Hugh for 11 years, before they got divorced in 2010. She is a former Playmate of the year. Which means Marston is probably the only man in history who was arrested for beating a Playmate who is also the son of a Playmate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-cameron-douglas-michael-douglas><strong>9. Cameron Douglas-Michael Douglas</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> has had his share of problems, there is no doubt at all about that. There have long been many rumors out there about the personal demons he has faced. His son Cameron has had his share of issues too. Most of them are because of drugs. He has been busted for possession numerous times, and served up five years in prison for selling methamphetamine, which he was doing from an expensive hotel in Manhattan. He ended up breaking prison rules numerous times trying to get drugs and spent two<span class=edS-i>&nbsp;years in solitary confinement.&nbsp;</span>He was released this past summer and at last count was living in a halfway house. His dad has taken the blame for much of this and said he had been a bad father to Cameron.</p><h2 id=8-richard-hilfiger-tommy-hilfiger><strong>8. Richard Hilfiger-Tommy&nbsp;</strong><b>Hilfiger</b></h2><p><a href=#>Tommy Hilfiger</a> is one of the richest and most successful designers of our, or any other generation. His son, Richard, is not quite so successful it would seem. One thing he is good at though, is being a total brat. First of all, he is trying to make a living as a rapper, and has a slew of awful tattoos, which is bratty enough, but then he punched a bouncer in the face after he "allegedly got upset after security told him he wouldn't be allowed into the swanky club because his friend's outfit was too scruffy for the club's dress code. Hilfiger was charged with battery and disorderly conduct as well as possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana." Super cool Richard, you are lucky you just got arrested, instead of having the bouncer beat you down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-bryson-bryant-nene-leakes><strong>7. Bryson Bryant-NeNe Leakes</strong></h2><p><a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a> is best known for being one of the stars of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Atlanta,&nbsp;as well as being a fashion designer and an author.&nbsp;She is also known for having a super bratty son, who keeps getting arrested for doing some really ignorant (and criminal), things, such as recently he was "arrested at a Georgia McDonald's for charges related to the forgery of Taco Bell checks last summer.This is not the first time that Bryant had found himself in trouble with the law. His arrests since 2010 have been for crimes ranging from drug possession, to DUI, to shoplifting two Mach 3 razors from a Wal-Mart." Come on man, buy your own razors for crying out loud, or at least go into a more high class place to try and steal them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-tallulah-willis-bruce-willis-and-demi-moore><strong>6. Tallulah Willis-Bruce Willis and Demi Moore</strong></h2><p>Remember when <a href=#>Bruce Willis </a>and <a href=#>Demi Moore</a> were like the coolest couple you had ever seen anywhere, and they had a daughter and they named her <a href=#>Rumer</a>, and it seemed like it was so special and would last forever? So do I- kind of, anyway. Well, a lot has happened since then. Rumer had her own share of troubles, but not so much as her younger sister Tallulah has, who went into rehab at the age of 20 after partying hard for years. &nbsp;It seems like the combination of Bruce, Demi, and Demi's second husband <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> did not do a whole lot to keep her from boozing and doing a ton of drugs. What a surprise. I know this sounds all judgmental, and I don't mean it to be, people should do what they do, but come on; hundreds of millions of dollars and famous absentee parents seem like a bad combination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-jaycee-chan-jackie-chan><strong>5. Jaycee Chan-Jackie Chan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jackie Chan</a> is one of the most likable stars out there; I mean everyone loves Jackie Chan, right? Well, being well loved didn't help him keep his son out of trouble with dealing drugs. What makes this whole thing even worse was that Jackie was once named China's anti-drug ambassador. His son Jaycee Chan, was arrested in a drug bust in Beijing, and sentenced to six months in prison for&nbsp;having over 100 grams of marijuana. Now as far as this list goes, having 100 grams of marijuana is not a very big deal, but still China has a different culture and Jackie Chan is a huge star. I mean, really, do you think his kid needs the money from the 100 grams of marijuana that he was selling? Nope, I think he is just a brat.</p><h2 id=4-bobbi-kristina-brown-whitney-houston-and-bobby-brown><strong>4.&nbsp;Bobbi Kristina Brown-Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown</strong></h2><p>One has to feel a little bit bad; okay, let me take that back- one has to feel really bad for <a href=#>Bobbi Kristina Brown</a>. Being the daughter of <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a> and <a href=#>Bobby Brown</a> most certainly had to be a wild ride, and it obviously took its toll on their daughter. At one point he was seen doing cocaine in a video that made the rounds. When her mother died after accidentally drowning in the bathtub, Bobbi inherited her entire estate, but it did little to ease her heartbreak. Amazingly, a few years after Whitney's death, Bobbi was found unresponsive in a bathtub, and died soon afterwards. Both deaths were rumored to have been because of some sort of intoxication related to drugs, making this such a truly sad story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-indio-downey-robert-downey-jr><strong>3. Indio Downey-Robert Downey Jr.</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a> is known as one of the biggest success stories when it comes to recovering from addiction. He was a huge star in his early 20s before he started getting in trouble with the law because of his illegal drug use. He was even incarcerated numerous times before he finally kicked the drugs. He has remained clean for decades, and has become an ever bigger star than he was before. So he must have been devastated when his son Indio was arrested for possessing cocaine and charged with a felony count of possession of a controlled substance. His dad sent him to rehab, and after completing it Indio had his<a href=#> charges wiped </a>off his record. Let's hope his behavior gets better- just like his dad's did.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-weston-cage-nicholas-cage><strong>2. Weston Cage-Nicholas Cage</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nicolas Cage </a>is one of Hollywood's biggest actors, who has appeared as the star in numerous blockbusters, and is also part of a huge Hollywood family, since he is the nephew of famed director <a href=#>Francis Ford Coppola</a>. So, since he is so famous and wealthy, it would only stand to reason that he has a son who is a total brat, right? His son Winston has been arrested for domestic violence and has also been to rehab for his problems with drugs. Worst of all on the brat scale, he seems to try to be all tough and scary with his appearance, which is kind of hard to do when you are totally rich and spoiled. It seems that Winston is now clean and sober and is trying to further his career in acting. Do any of these people have jobs?</p><h2 id=1-chet-hanks-tom-hanks><strong>1. Chet Hanks-Tom Hanks</strong></h2><p>Another Hollywood brat type who most certainly does not have a job, is Chet Hanks, who is the son of <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> and <a href=#>Rita Wilson </a>and has been trying to start a career in rap under the name Chet Haze. As you can see here he is<a href=#> pretty awful</a>. I would tell him not to quit his day job, but of course he doesn't have one. Chet has had numerous problems with drugs and has gone to rehab more than once. &nbsp;According to Radaronline “Tom has been beating himself up over Chet losing his bearings,” confided an insider. “He’s putting the fault squarely on his shoulders for not being attentive enough during his formative years. Instead, he chose to put his career first and foremost before his family.” Chet Hanks recently had a kid and is now trying to stay clean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=#>mirror</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Xv6LA07JkpKGUqHq4tM5mop6doGKxs63GoKCnn12ptaa10WadmqWfqsBuvMCrnKeso2KxsMPNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./everything-we-know-about-juice-wrld-s-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything We Know About Juice WRLDs Death">&larr;
