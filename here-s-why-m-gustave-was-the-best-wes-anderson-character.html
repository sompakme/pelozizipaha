It tells the tale of Monsieur Gustave H., the esteemed concierge of a luxurious mountainside resort in the Republic of Zubrowka in the 1930s. Gustave regularly seduces old, wealthy, female guests at the hotel. When one of his guests, a dowager named Madame D., mysteriously dies, Gustave is framed for murder. He and his protégé, Zero, set out on a quest to prove his innocence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film debuted in 2014 with a star-studded cast, including <a href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a>, Jude Law, Bill Murray, <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a>, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody and others. It exceeded the expectations of critics and audiences around the globe, earning $172.9 worldwide. It also received multiple BAFTA and Academy Awards for best costume design, best original music score and best original screenplay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ralph-Fiennes-Grand-Budapest-Hotel.png><p>Though the legendary Ralph Fiennes, who played Gustave, did not earn an Oscar for his work in The Grand Budapest Hotel, many fans believe that he portrayed one of the best Wes Anderson characters to date. Fiennes is known to be quite the chameleon when it comes to acting, having played Voldemort in the <a href=#>Harry Potter series</a>, SS Officer Amon Goeth in Schindler’s List&nbsp;and Hades in Wrath of the Titans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-magic-of-monsieur-gustave-h>The Magic of Monsieur Gustave H.</h2><p>As in any Wes Anderson film, the protagonist of The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strong one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">M. Gustave</a> is a curious, complex, serious, humorous and quite peculiar character. He writes romantic poetry and has a taste for finer things. He orders the best food for the hotel, including Mendl’s pastries. The pastries, which are delivered by Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), are exquisite, scrumptious sweets and believed by Gustave to be the greatest in all of Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/saoirse-ronan-in-grand-budapest-hotel.jpg><p>Gustave's life’s work is the hotel.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfectionist, he makes sure that every employee is doing their upmost to keep the hotel in tip-top shape. He wants to ensure that his legacy lives on, so he takes his new lobby boy, Zero, under his wing and trains him in the ways of a concierge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet Gustave himself is not a perfect person. He "services” his rich, older, female guests. He has been “servicing” Madame D. for nearly two decades. Though he prides himself on his sophistication and professionalism, he sees nothing wrong with his love affairs. In fact, he is quite frank and open about them. This odd quirk makes Gustave an interesting character and allows the audience to see a side of him that isn’t as appealing.</p><p>Gustave’s life is turned upside down when Madame D. mysteriously dies and leaves him a priceless Renaissance painting called “Boy with Apple.” Upon hearing this news, Madame’s son, Dmitri, is furious and orders that Gustave be arrested.</p><p>Through Gustave’s flight, subsequent arrest and escape from prison, the audience begins to see a new side of his zany character. He is kind and brave, unfazed by the dangers of his missions. He stands up for his protégé Zero, who often finds himself in trouble because of his refugee status. Gustave defends Zero to the very end and eventually makes him his sole heir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His growth over the course of his journey illustrated how his good qualities outshone his bad qualities. He did not begin his quest to win Madame’s fortune. He wanted to clear his name, claim what was rightfully his, and stop the bad guys.</p><h2 id=how-ralph-fiennes-brought-the-character-to-life>How Ralph Fiennes Brought the Character to Life</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Vanity Fair</a>, Ralph Fiennes revealed where he drew a great deal of his inspiration in playing Monsieur Gustave. He didn’t have to look much farther than the director himself.</p><p>“Wes [Anderson] isn’t Gustave,” Fiennes began. “But I think a lot of that, that attentiveness, I think a lot of the spirit of Gustave comes from Wes, who’s very, very charming, highly sensitive to other people, and loves to create an atmosphere and an environment that’s not just a good working environment... it’s also just, it’s an energy between various people.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ralph-fiennes-in-grand-budapest-hotel-2.jpg><p>Fiennes was also drawn to the character from his very first read of the script. “Gustave was a very attractive part on the page,” he explained. “There are people like Gustave. I think it’s about sort of controlling an environment. Creating an environment, because it’s essentially creative. And about control, organization.”</p><p>Fiennes then revealed how Wes Anderson encouraged him to get comfortable in the role. “He’s prepared something precisely, but he definitely seems to want the actor to come with whoever they are,” Fiennes said. “And then he wants them to breathe life into it. And then he hears the lines in the mouth of any given actor, and he starts to give you a direction. But it always made sense. He’s a very sensitive man, sensitive to actors. He’s an interesting mix, because he’s tenacious to get to the place where he’s happy, but he does it with sensitivity and patience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through Wes Anderson’s careful direction and Ralph Fiennes’s creative abilities, Monsieur Gustave H. came to life and became quite a magical character.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things About Voldemort Most Harry Potter Fans Don't Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpKtll6rAta3VnmSwmaNiwamxjJucrKxdrLK0ecCnm56qo6S7bq%2FHmqmam6Sav3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-recover-deleted-word-documents-on-mac.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to recover deleted word documents on mac">&larr;
