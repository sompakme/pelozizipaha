Though they opted to keep it low-key, fans are overjoyed to know that the two finally exchanged vows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Have Mixed Feelings About Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani’s Songs Getting Mixed</a></span></p><p>As they say, fairytale endings don’t happen in real life, but Blake and Shelton’s relationship says otherwise.</p><p>From the way the two look at each other, to creating songs together, there is no doubt that they are soulmates. However, multiple sources claimed that Blake and Gwen had to sign a prenup agreement before getting married.</p><p>Do they really have to do it to protect their respective net worths?</p><h2 id=did-blake-and-gwen-sign-a-prenup-to-protect-their-net-worths>Did Blake And Gwen Sign A Prenup To Protect Their Net Worths?</h2><p>Fans of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are surely glad to see that the celebrity couple is doing well after all the rumors surrounding their relationship. Unfortunately, reports have surfaced that the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to sign a prenup</a> to protect their respective net worths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told Radar, “Gwen is worth around $150 million while Blake is worth around $100 million. Both have been married before and both have experienced very ugly divorces. Which explains why this time they both wanted to have a prenup. Some people might think this is unromantic but both Gwen and Blake think it is sensible.”</p><p>Another "insider" also claimed that Blake and Gwen “have been in prenup talks for a few months” and the “process has been extremely effortless.”</p><p>The source further added that there have been “no hiccups, or outrages demands” during the couple’s discussions because they are “two mature adults that love each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source also revealed that since Gwen didn’t have a prenup with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, “she just can’t afford to not have it with Blake.”</p><p>It turns out Gavin’s net worth is allegedly only $45 million. Regardless of how they ended their relationship, the discrepancy between their net worths likely came up during the divorce proceedings.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gwen Stefani Expertly Trolls 2 Of The World’s Thirstiest Blake Shelton Fans</a></span></p><p>Blake and Gwen, however, are tight-lipped about the alleged prenup agreement, so it is best to take the reports with a grain of salt.</p><p>But if it really exists, it just shows clearly that the duo isn’t letting emotion overrule common sense as a prenup proves that they share mutual respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-really-is-worth-more-gwen-or-blake>Who Really Is Worth More, Gwen Or Blake?</h2><p>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are both incredible artists, but they're also in comparable periods in their lives. With previous marriages behind them and a long life ahead of them, the two have decided to marry and have a family. Of course, for a couple with such a large net worth as these two, settling down looks different.</p><p>The true issue is <a href=#>which star brought a bigger net worth to the marriage</a>. Blake has a history of tearing up the charts, as country fans are well aware. He has created his own net worth despite being in an entirely different class than his now-wife.</p><p>Sure, Adam Levine might have alleged that <a href=#>Blake wasn't 'cool enough' for Gwen</a>, but he's certainly wealthy enough! In early seasons of the show The Voice, he was pulling in $4 million per cycle, which now stands at a whopping $13 million every season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, his songs have generated billions of digital streams.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can’t Stop Talking About How Blake Shelton Gets Better With Age As 20 Years Of Him Being An Artist Passed</a></span></p><p>The country crooner is also the proud owner of a string of Ole Road restaurants. His latest resto is located in Orlando, Florida, which reportedly was set to open in April 2020.</p><p>In addition, he owns Ten Point ranch, which is just an hour drive from his Lake Texoma home where he penned and recorded his album, Texoma Shore.</p><p>According to multiple sources, he's worth a cool $100 million. That's partly to his numerous hit albums, of course, but also his stint on The Voice.</p><h2 id=gwen-39-s-net-worth-outpaces-her-husband-39-s>Gwen's Net Worth Outpaces Her Husband's</h2><p>For Gwen Stefani, sources placed her estimated value around $150 million. Much of her wealth is amassed through her efforts as both a solo act and as a member of No Doubt, as well as her other ventures such as her clothing line, and other products ranging from perfumes, makeup, accessories, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one thing, she's lent her voice to recent animated projects (like Trolls and King of the Hill), but she's also appeared in films (like The Aviator).</p><p>Not only that, but Gwen has of course dabbled in various shows apart from The Voice, and she pulls down a similarly impressive salary to Blake's millions for that role.</p><p>The wedding of Blake and Gwen delighted both of their fan communities. And with their mega-wealth, it doesn't really matter who's worth more; they'd be able to pay the bills and spend freely with plenty of money left over.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Miranda Lambert Recalls ‘Special Moment’ With Ex-Husband Blake Shelton</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpZmbmnq0tMSlq6imXaOytXnWqKmtoF2cxKa6jKyrnp6Ro7ZuvNGepa6opJ6urXnAoKmenZ2au7V5zJqpq6GRnLJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./edp445-cupcake-meme-tiktok-trend-and-meaning-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Edp445 Cupcake Meme  TikTok Trend And Meaning Explained ">&larr;
