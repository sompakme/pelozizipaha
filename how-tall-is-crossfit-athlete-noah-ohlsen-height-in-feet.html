Regardless, Ohlsen is leaving with quite the achievements as he has amassed a lot of trophies.</p><p>He started his career in 2011 when he was ranked 1320th in the world when it come to the Men’s division.&nbsp;He slowly and steadily climbed his way up. Moving from 1320th to 188th to 56th to 20th to 16th, finally reaching the 1st position in 2016.</p><p>He retained the top five positions the following year by coming in second but slid down to 25th and then 60th in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>He rushed back up to the top 10s in 2020 and 2021 when he maintained the 6th position both years but fell to 107th in 2022 and, perhaps because of that, has chosen to retire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHq1rculZKKrXZi%2FsL%2FSn6CtZZGpta2x055kp6eRnXqwtMusnKdlmJq2qLTTZqCnZZaasrV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-aries-man-shows-his-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Howariesmanshowshislove>&larr;
