On the Friday, October 21, episode of <i><a href=#>Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars</a>,</i>&nbsp;the couples learned some basic lessons for how to fight fair — or at least, they were supposed to learn them. It was unclear how much actually sunk in.</p><p>Things started out rocky as <i>Mob Wives’</i>&nbsp;<b>Karen Gravano</b> and her boyfriend,&nbsp;<b>Storm</b>, continued to spar over his lack of emotion or commitment to the exercise in which Karen posed like a corpse. “You couldn’t even say ‘I’m sorry! I love you!'” Karen screamed. “You couldn’t even say two words!” Listening to the fight from the other side of the house, <b><a href=#>Tanner Tobert</a> </b>said he thought Storm and Karen had the “biggest issues” of any of the couples there.</p><p>“If you don’t shut the f–k up, I’m out!” Storm shouted at Karen. “Shut the f–k up! Period!” Karen crumpled onto their bed in tears, but Storm didn’t seem remotely concerned about how she was feeling or the pain he was causing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Three’s a Crowd</b></p><p>Things weren’t any better for <i>Love & Hip Hop</i>‘s <b>Margeaux</b>, her girlfriend, <b>Merika</b>, and her husband, <b>Nikko</b>. The threesome continued to bicker nonstop about whether Margeaux had or had not technically cheated on Nikko way back in the day. Margeaux argued that she hadn’t felt Nikko had fully committed to her, so her side activities weren’t really straying.</p><p>Margeaux became increasingly frustrated with both of her loves until she declared, “I’m out of this house! I’m not staying here any more!” She reasoned further that she couldn’t speak to Nikko because he had too much resentment built up around their past. Merika jumped on the bandwagon and told Margeaux that Nikko had pissed her off in exactly the same way he had pissed Margeaux off. Rather than unite them, however (which Merika had probably hoped), it only upset Margeaux more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Keke Tells Michael to Kill Himself</b></p><p><b>Keke Wyatt</b> showed a hint of her insane temper when she and her husband, <b>Michael Ford</b>, were supposed to participate in a relationship-rescue exercise that involved her potentially falling into a swimming pool. Declaring that she couldn’t swim and didn’t want to get in the water, Keke refused to get on board, prompting Michael to be extremely annoyed.</p><p>That didn’t matter to the singer, though, and instead of working it out with her better half, she stormed out and demanded the cameras not follow her. “Kill yourself!” she shouted as she ran away. Later she added, “You can just go kill yourself. You can go float in the river!” Michael actually seemed really hurt by that — and was more distressed that evening when Keke had locked him out of their room. “You can live your life by yourself, and I’ll live mine,” she argued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Amber Calls Jim an Alcoholic</b></p><p>Keke wasn’t the only one who didn’t do so well with the swimming pool exercise, however. <b>Amber </b>and <b>Jim Marchese</b> had one heck of a time fighting in front of everyone. Amber said to Jim, “You drink too much, and I tell you that. Stop f–king drinking.” As Jim stared on, clearly getting angry, Amber added, “You think you’re a frat boy, so it’s f–king normal.” Tears welled in her eyes, and she said, “We drink until oblivion.” The other couples were surprised to hear these accusations, but footage from Jim later that evening seemed to confirm that he did, indeed, drink more than he should.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Stop drinking! It has created so many problems!” Amber screamed as Jim jumped into the swimming pool to end their fight. Amber called that a cop-out and started screaming at her husband that she didn’t need him to protect her.</p><p>Jim then went and found Merika and spent a lot of time drinking with her, cozying up to her and telling her he thought she belonged with Margeaux (though he also told Nikko that, for what it’s worth).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Judge Toler Punishes Jim</b></p><p>After giving out some basic evaluations of how each couple had done, Judge <b>Lynn Toler</b> gave out her first punishment to someone who really wasn’t getting with the program. While many campers had speculated Keke would be the recipient of the punishment for refusing to participate in the swimming pool exercise, it turned out that honor went to Jim for giving “the worst advice” to Merika with “a sense of authority.”</p><p>The judge put a big piece of tape over Jim’s mouth and told him it needed to stay there for a full 30 minutes. Amber thought 30 minutes was way too short. Of course, Jim figured out a way to communicate without talking, grabbing a pad of paper and a pen. As Jim scribbled messages furiously on his pad, Amber said he needed to practice hearing what other people had to say instead of “spewing out” his words of wisdom all the time.</p><p>The second the time was up, Jim ripped the tape off victoriously.</p><p>Tell<i> Us:</i> Do you think there’s any hope for Amber and Jim?</p><p><i>Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars </i>airs on WE tv Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqqKerqixjJumqKxdmK6uvIyknKSdXazGosDTZquoZZiqwKOtzZ1kpKGcoXq6u9Srqp6klmLEdYCVa2hvZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./connie-smith-net-worth-how-much-is-connie-smith-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Connie Smith Net Worth  How Much is Connie Smith Worth?">&larr;
