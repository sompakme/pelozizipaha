And I showed them this little song I had called ‘Stand By me’ on the piano. The called the musicians back into the studio and he did what’s called a hell arrangement, which is something you come up with right away because you don’t have a lot of time, and of course, Jerry Lee and Mike Stoller came up with the bassline right there on the spot.”</p><p>Since becoming a classic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the song has been featured in TV shows</a> like The Wonder Years and Friends, and has also been in countless movies.</p><p>Beyond its use in film and television, Stand By Me has become a go-to choice for commercials and public events aiming to evoke a sense of unity and togetherness. It was even included in the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.</p><p>Through the years, It has been covered and reimagined by numerous artists, a testament to its enduring appeal.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hollywood-paid-a-fortune-to-finally-get-access-to-a-classic-led-zeppelin-song-front-back_commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Hollywood Paid A Fortune To Finally Get Access To A Classic Led Zeppelin Song">Hollywood Paid A Fortune To Finally Get Access To A Classic Led Zeppelin Song</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Led Zeppelin made millions with a song that was released over 50 years ago by allowing it to be featured in a popular superhero film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-song-itself-has-been-covered-countless-times-including-a-version-done-by-john-lennon>The Song Itself Has Been Covered Countless Times, Including A Version Done By John Lennon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-1.jpg><p>One of the most famous cover versions of the song is the one done by Beatles legend, John Lennon.</p><p>"The Lennon version of “Stand By Me” is not as dramatic and visually compelling as Ben E. King’s. Lennon’s rendition, however, does convey strength and faithfulness. His performance is captivating and memorable. One can hear the joy he felt in singing it. That wasn’t the case on all the oldies he recorded on Rock ‘n’ Roll. Obviously there were some he felt more deeply about. That comes through with the rocking spirit he grants “Stand By Me.” The song becomes his proclamation as well," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decaturish penned about Lennon's version</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song has also been covered by folks like Tracy Chapman, Otis Redding, Florence and the Machine, and even John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon.
