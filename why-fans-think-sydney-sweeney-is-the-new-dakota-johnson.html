Not only is she <a href=#>making and spending some legit bank</a>, but she's also become one of the most recognizable stars of the teen drama aside from Zendaya. Her fans want to know everything about her, including <a href=#>why she keeps her boyfriend a secret</a>. The Washington State-born actor (who has also started her own production company) has made a number of exceptionally smart career moves. But many of them have caused fans to compare her to Fifty Shades of Grey star Dakota Johnson. That's not exactly an insult. Even though Dakota has slowly fallen out of the spotlight since 2018's Fifty Shades Freed, she's worked consistently ever since and has become a true icon. And it seems Sydney is swiftly earning the same status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Furious About Sydney Sweeney's Boyfriend, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>The specific icon status that Dakota has held for years, and the one that Sydney is swiftly earning for herself, is that of the meaningful sex symbol. Not the one without dimension, but the one who empowers women to come into their own, take control of what they want, and simultaneously cause everyone who lusts after them to try and pick up their jaws from the floor. While Sydney's role as Cassie Howard on Euphoria has been compared to Dakota's Anatasia Steele, it's her most recent role that has drawn the strongest comparisons between the two talented women...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on March 16, 2022: </strong>The similarities between Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson just keep on coming! According to an exclusive report from Deadline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Sweeney has been cast to appear alongside Dakota Johnson</a> in the upcoming film Madam Web, which will be part of the Sony Marvel Universe. Deadline had previously reported that Johnson was set to play the mysterious Madame Web, but it has yet to be revealed who Sweeney will be playing in the film. Sweeney joins her Euphoria co-star Zendaya in the Song Marvel Universe, who has played MJ in the last three Sony Spider-Man films.</p><h2 id=39-the-voyeurs-39-is-the-new-39-fifty-shades-of-grey-39-and-sydney-the-new-dakota>'The Voyeurs' Is The New 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' And Sydney The New Dakota</h2><p>It's hard not to see some similarities in Sydney and Dakota's mannerisms and appearance. Both have delicate voices and big doe-eyes that just stare into your soul. Filmmakers know it as they often linger on them when they have the chance to work with these two talents. But they also have made very similar career choices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether Sydney likes it or not, her new film, Amazon's The Voyeurs, is constantly being compared to Fifty Shades of Grey. Although, to be fair, fans are claiming that it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifty Shades Of Grey with "a better story"</a>, according to The Daily Mail. While Fifty Shades Of Grey took a minute to venture into the erotic thriller territory that Basic Instinct, Eyes Wide Shut, Disclosure, and Chloe did so well, The Voyeurs is all about it from the start.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why The Internet Is Obsessed With Dakota Johnson's Kitchen">Why The Internet Is Obsessed With Dakota Johnson's Kitchen</a></span></p><p>For those who don't know, the 2021 film follows a young couple (played by Sydney and Justice Smith) who move across the street from a couple (Ben Hardy and Natasha Liu Bordizzo) and become infatuated by their sex life. So much so that the otherwise innocent Pippa (Sydney's character) descends into a thrilling and erotic journey that she can't come back from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like Fifty Shades, The Voyeurs follows a girl next door type (literally in the case of The Voyeurs) who loses herself on an erotic journey with a more dominant man but eventually finds her own power through it. In Fifty Shades, it's a bit of a cheesier process. In The Voyeurs, it's a far, far, darker one.</p><p>But you can't simply compare these two actors for one similar project. The truth is, fans on the internet see the same similarities in multiple roles they've taken. For Dakota, her carnal journey was partially explored in Bad Times At The El Royale, A Bigger Splash, and Suspiria. For Sydney, her incredibly nuanced, respectful, and thoughtful role on Euphoria dives deeply into this subject as well as how it relates to a desire to feel loved and to love. However, Sydney has also used this aspect of her acting chops to some degree in The White Lotus, Vikes, Everything Sucks!, and Clementine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney Trolled For Attempting To Recreate Anna Nicole Smith Photoshoot</a></span></p><p>Both Sydney and Dakota have found a niche in the entertainment industry. But unlike many actors who have jumped at an erotic role in the past, both Dakota and Sydney have made a point of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">playing women who aren't just sex symbols</a>. Instead, they explore a deeper and more meaningful aspect of humanity through their sexuality.</p><h2 id=how-all-of-sydney-39-s-intimate-scenes-have-changed-her-life>How All Of Sydney's Intimate Scenes Have Changed Her Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Collider, Sydney and her Voyeurs co-star, Justice Smith spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what it was like shooting all of the intimate scenes</a> for the film. Sydney explained that she thought the scenes were empowering although she echoed what many celebrities say about sex scenes, that they are not nearly as hot to make as they are to watch.</p><p>"It's a business transaction. Everyone is there to work," Sydney explained. "There's nothing dainty about it. There's literally a guy holding a boom [microphone stick above your head during the intimate moments]."</p><p>While filming these kinds of scenes isn't all that attractive for Sydney in the way it is for those watching, it has helped her emotionally. During an interview with Good Morning America, Sydney discussed how shooting Euphoria, particularly all the intimate scenes on the show, has actually helped with her body dysmorphia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I definitely have become more free and confident with my body," Sydney explained to GMA. "I've definitely struggled with a lot of body dysmorphia and I've been self-conscious and judging myself in a very sick hard way. But with Cassie, everything is out there in the public and I can't really control that. So, it's helped me in a therapeutic, weird way accept my body in a different way because even when I was younger I had boobs in middle school. And I got horribly bullied for it because no one else had gone through puberty. And so I hated my body. So having a character like Cassie and embracing it has been really powerful for myself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why 'Euphoria's' Sydney Sweeney Is On Track To Earning A-List Status</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6Kmm2LAurDNnrBmq6easq%2Bx2GagrGWemsRusMCkpq2ZXZ%2B8qbrSqKVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billions-recap-hamster-wheel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billions Recap: Hamster Wheel">&larr;
