Her excellent work ethic has been shown when she and her sisters managed the Dash boutique. Since then, Khloé Kardashian focused on making a name for herself and becoming a well-known businesswoman. She collaborated with Emma Grede and launched the Good American denim brand in 2016 to empower women of all sizes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Khloé Kardashian focuses on promoting the brand as diverse, and inclusive, it seems not all of its employees consider Good American the best environment to work in.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-showed-her-work-ethic-with-dash>Khloe Kardashian Showed Her Work Ethic With Dash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/khloe-kardashian-at-the-2022-cfda-fashion-awards.jpg><p>It’s no secret that Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been a huge success, being one of the longest-running reality shows in television’s history with over twenty seasons. During filming, Khloe Kardashian, as well as her sisters and brother, grew up in front of millions of people, sharing their family’s ups and downs with the whole world.</p><p>Before fame changed their lives, the Kardashian-Jenner family was trying different ways to climb the success ladder through various business ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Khloe Kardashian Actually Pay Someone To Photoshop Her Pictures?</a></span></p><p>One of these was Dash, known for its trendy and chic clothing style. Founded by Kim, Khloé, and Kourtney Kardashian, many episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians show the sisters doing work for their clothing store.</p><p>While Kim and Kourtney Kardashian focused on the merchandising and design sides of the business, Khloé Kardashian was the most involved in managing day-to-day operations.</p><p>She showed a great work ethic for Dash during Keeping Up With The Kardashians. When compared to the other show they have, <a href=#>The Kardashians doesn't focus so much on this side of their lives</a>.</p><p>So, it’s not clear what happened with the brand or who's necessarily running it now—especially because Khloé moved on with other brands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-co-founded-good-american>Khloe Kardashian Co-Founded Good American</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/khloe-kardashian-posing-in-pj-place-s-loungewear-set.jpg><p>Even though Keeping Up With The Kardashians changed Khloe Kardashian’s life for the better, it’s no secret she also received a lot of backlash for her weight during the show. Since millions of people watched their families for more than one decade, this also came with criticism about their lives, habits, and more importantly their appearances.</p><p>When Emma Grede came up with the idea for creating a denim jeans brand for all sizes, <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian said yes to the opportunity</a> of using her immense platform to promote inclusivity and diversity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Good American became a hit and a ‘go-to’ brand for many of Khloé Kardashian’s fans and other people. As a result of the Good American's success, but also because of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and other endorsement deals, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian makes around $15 million per year</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Khloe Regret Having Another Baby With Tristan Thompson?</a></span></p><p>When it comes to what she likes to do with her money, Khloé Kardashian continues to pursue business opportunities and go on extravagant holidays.

Still, her professional life isn't making the same amount of headlines. Khloé Kardashian promotes the Good American brand at every opportunity she gets for its diversity and inclusivity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet doesn’t seem everyone feels as if they belong in the Good American environment. Matthew Manhard, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of Khloé Kardashian’s former staff members sued her</a> and revealed many details from his experience.</p><p>He didn’t stop there and actually called working with Khloé Kardashian a ‘nightmare.’</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of Khloe Kardashian's Biggest Scandals</a></span></p><p>This came after Matthew Manhard suffered a knee injury and didn’t work for some time because of his medical condition. Then, he claimed that Khloé gave him so much work that he couldn’t take his breaks. Also, Matthew Manhard accused her of not paying for his overtime work regularly, even though he worked for more than 10 hours daily.</p><p>After Khloé fired him when he tried to come back to work, Matthew Manhard sued her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-have-a-lot-to-say-about-the-incident>Fans Have A Lot To Say About The Incident</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Kardashians-scene.jpg><p>This incident didn’t sit well with Khloé Kardashian’s fans because the bad working conditions are a hot topic in the Kardashian-Jenners' businesses. When fans heard that Khloé Kardashian is sued by a former staff member, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they weren’t so surprised</a>.</p><p>Comparing this incident with others related to Kim Kardashian, fans consider it something that "always happens" with the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time former staff members came forward to reveal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what it’s like to work for the Kardashians</a>.
