No one can afford to drive cars or live in nice places anymore; the city is filled with crime, problems and trash. One of the poor, lost citizens of this new America is a genetically engineered super soldier, escaped from the lab that created her and a collection of other genetically engineered kids. Dark Angel was set in a very dark world. The lead was <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> who played Max, one of the escaped kids who just wants to be normal. Now full grown, she works for a messenger service in the post-collapse Seattle. She is also looking for her long-lost guinea pig “siblings” while avoiding the Feds trying to drag her back into the lab. The handsome and wealthy wheelchair bound journalist Logan, played by <a href=#>Michael Weatherly</a>, is Alba’s sidekick and love interest. The two start battling corruption and crime in this scary, torn apart world together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dark Angel ran from 2000 to 2002 with just two short, beloved seasons. The story was imaginative, new, and bold. However, it was cancelled in 2002, leaving us with just&nbsp;42&nbsp;episodes of Alba kicking butt on the SciFi channel. The series really put Alba on the map in Hollywood and gave Weatherly’s career a boost as well. The cast of Dark Angel haven’t all been seen together since 2002. So what have all of our favorite, genetically engineered stars been up to? Where are they today?</p><h2 id=10-jessica-alba---max-guevera><strong>10. Jessica Alba - Max Guevera</strong></h2><p>Sex symbol <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> hasn’t slowed down since her days as Max. The actress has been seen continuing to kick butt in her role in the recent Fantastic Four movies, pole dancing in Sin City, and even tried her hand a few rom coms, like the Love Guru and Good Luck Chuck. She’s recently been seen in the star studded Spoils of Babylon. Alba has also a built a very successful non-toxic consumer goods company called the Honest Company and lives quite happily with her handsome hubby <a href=#>Cash Warren</a> and their two precious little girls. The star hasn’t quite given up on acting just yet; the California mama has two movies coming up in 2016. The crime thriller Mechanic: Resurrection and an adventure comedy called Dear Eleanor are set to hit the big screen some time this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-michael-weatherly---logan-cale><strong>9. Michael Weatherly - Logan Cale</strong></h2><p>After his stint on Dark Angel, Weatherly has taken a few small parts here and there. But his most important role since 2002 was a small part he played on two episodes of JAG. That bit part was NCIS Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. He reprised the role again in the highly successful NCIS spinoff from JAG, and hasn’t looked back. Nearly everything Weatherly has done since 2003 revolved around his role in NCIS. However, Weatherly recently announced he would be leaving the show after it’s newest season, probably to be replaced by Duane Henry, a very sexy male model with a very sexy British accent. Weatherly has yet to announce what he plans to do after his almost 15-year run with the show, but we sincerely doubt he’ll be out of work long!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-richard-gunn---calvin-sketchy-theodore><strong>8. Richard Gunn - Calvin 'Sketchy' Theodore</strong></h2><p>Sketchy, one of Max’s less than reputable buddies, was played by Richard Gunn. Gunn was around in Hollywood for many years before finally returning to TV for his part as John Sanders in Granite Flats. The show ran from 2013 to 2015. The actor also appeared in the creepy Netflix original Hemlock Grove as Aitor Quantic in season 2 and 3. He said in a recent interview, he wished Netflix had been around in 2002, stating that, "I think Dark Angel may have gone for at least a few more seasons.” Well, streaming services have brought back Full House, so why not Dark Angel too?</p><p></p><h2 id=7-j-c-mackenzie---reagan-normal-ronald><strong>7. J.C. MacKenzie - Reagan 'Normal' Ronald</strong></h2><p>After his role as Normal in Dark Angel ended in 2002, J.C. MacKenzie continued on to have a great career, appearing in several movie titles before returning to TV. He had a recurring character on The Shield as well as a part in the TV dramedy Gigantic. Must like his pal Sketchy, MacKenzie landed a role in the Netflix original Hemlock Grove as Dr. Arnold Spivak. In 2016, the actor is working on a sexy HBO 1970s show called Vinyl. MacKenzie has 150 TV and movie credits and counting, showing no signs of slowing down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-valarie-rae-miller---cynthia-original-cindy-mceachin><strong>6. Valarie Rae Miller - Cynthia 'Original Cindy' McEachin</strong></h2><p>Valarie Rae Miller played Cynthia, the openly gay sassy BFF of Max in Dark Angel. She was fantastic in the role. Lucky for us, Miller is still acting, but keeps mostly to TV roles. She had a short appearance on NCIS with her old buddy Michael Weatherly, appeared in Men of a Certain Age, and was in Smith a short-lived crime thriller about pro criminals. She also appeared in CW show Reaper, a comedy about a kid who finds out his parents sold his soul to the devil as a baby. The actress looks like she has finally made a break into movies in 2016; she’s in the upcoming Liza, Liza, Skies Are Grey, a coming-of-age drama about a road trip set in the 1960s.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-john-savage---donald-lydecker><strong>5. John Savage - Donald Lydecker</strong></h2><p>American-born John Savage is an actor, producer, composer and production manager, keeping exceptionally busy. Savage played Donald in Dark Angel. The actor has been famous since the 1970s, and best known for his appearances in The Deer Hunter, The Godfather: Part III, and The Thin Red Line. The cancellation of Dark Angel didn’t slow him down in the slightest. With nearly 20 movies due out in 2016 or 2017, Savage isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The aging actor is married to his second wife, Sandi Schultz, with whom he has been married since 1993. He has two adult children from a previous marriage.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-jensen-ackles---alec><strong>4. Jensen Ackles&nbsp;-&nbsp;Alec</strong></h2><p>Sexy man Alec, played by <a href=#>Jensen Ackles</a>, is still melting hearts everywhere. He played C.J. in Dawson’s Creek and is still playing Dean in the hit thriller Supernatural. The CW is on its 11th season and has been renewed (not surprisingly) for its 12th season. “If they can keep delivering stories, and the numbers keep holding, and the guys want to do it, we’re going to try to keep going,” said CW executive Mark Pedowitz in an interview in January 2016. The sexy star is a huge fan of playing sports and lending his voice to cartoons and video games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-alimi-ballard---herbal-thought><strong>3. Alimi Ballard - Herbal Thought</strong></h2><p>Alimi Ballard was born in the Bronx, New York in 1977. When he acted as Max’s pal Herbal Thought in Dark Angel, he got through season one before disappearing as a character for season two without explanation. But Herbal Thought’s actor went on to much better things, showing off his acting chops as a recurring character in NCIS and his role as David Sinclair in Numb3rs. The actor is also active in the motivational community, giving talks to churches and crowds all over, specializing in Youth Leadership. The actor is all set to continue work on the crime drama The Catch on ABC.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-martin-cummins---ames-white><strong>2. Martin Cummins - Ames White</strong></h2><p>Martin Cummins continued in TV when his role as Ames White on Dark Angel was cancelled, playing small parts in the Superman prequel TV series Smallville and The 4400. He also has roles on the alien invasion sci fi thriller V and the kid’s show Kyle XY. Cummins has kept busy this year, appearing in the drama When Calls the Heart as Henry Gowen. The Canadian actor has also appeared in tons of made for TV movies. He is also a producer and he has a horror movie currently in post-production called Hell in a Handbag where he is also acting. Cummins has married to his second wife, Christine Wallace, since 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-kevin-durand-joshua><strong>1. Kevin Durand – Joshua</strong></h2><p>Vikings actor <a href=#>Kevin Durand</a> once played Joshua in Dark Angel. Between 2002 and now, the actor has popped up in many films and TV series and made for TV movies since 2002, including the gritty western film 3:10 to Yuma, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and as Martin Keamy on Lost. The star and his wife, Sandra, welcomed their first child (a baby girl) in September 2015. He is currently still work on the insanely popular History Channel’s drama Vikings and also the horror vampire hunter TV show the Strain on FX. The actor says that coming into the series Vikings in the third season was very nerve wracking since he was already a huge fan of the show.</p><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>Showbiz411</a>, <a href=#>StarNewsOnline</a>, <a href=#>GreatBlackSpeakers</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatoJVisaK%2BymaYp5%2BVoXqkrdKtZLCglaeybq3RnmStoJWueq%2B71mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-about-simu-liu-and-awkwafina-s-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Simu Liu And Awkwafina's Relationship">&larr;
