Called The After, the pop star co-hosted the event with Diddy.</p><p>Some of the famous guests were Cardi B and husband Offset, Paris Hilton, Emily Ratajkowski, Teyana Taylor, Naomi Campbell, and even Kylie's sister, Kendall, who was seen covering her face from the paps as she was trailed by <a href=#>new boyfriend, Bad Bunny</a>.</p><p>No wonder Kylie being "shut out" of the party seemed off. Doja is also a frequent collaborator of Tyga, the ex-boyfriend of the <a href=#>makeup mogul who hates using her own products</a>.</p><p>Did the incident have something to do with that? Here's what's really going on between Doja and Kylie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Kylie Jenner Pay More For Her Extravagant House Than Her Equally Famous And Rich Siblings?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-doja-dress-as-a-cat-for-met-gala>Why Did Doja Dress As A Cat For Met Gala?</h2><p>Doja's look has been labeled all sorts of things — from avant-garde to weird. But to her, it's all about not taking yourself too seriously. "I use fashion to express myself," she said of her first Met Gala in <a href=#>Vogue's behind-the-scenes video</a>. "So, bottom line, any time that I'm doing something like this that's avant-garde or out of the ordinary, it's another way of just me expressing myself and also whoever I'm working with."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fvfgkuqwiaaxn8r.jpeg><p>She added: "There's nothing like sending a message through what you're wearing and having a story behind something. I think it's really refreshing to see when people do stuff like that." Creative director and stylist, Brett Alan Nelson also acknowledged that there's "no one better" than Doja to wear such "a very talked-about look."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's exhausting to take yourself so seriously to the point where you're limiting your experience in your life," the singer said of not being "like other girls," noting that "I love to embrace everything. I don't like to hide things, I don't like to mask myself and think that that needs to be my life for the rest of my life. I like to think outside the box." Now we get why Doja just spoke to Emma Chamberlain in "meows" during that viral red carpet interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Doja Cat Really Didn't Like People Commenting On Her Weight Loss</a></span></p><h2 id=was-kylie-jenner-really-blocked-from-doja-cat-39-s-met-gala-party>Was Kylie Jenner Really Blocked From Doja Cat's Met Gala Party?</h2><p>On May 2, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six confirmed</a> that Kylie didn't make it inside Doja's party. "They wouldn't let her in," a bystander told the outlet, clarifying that "they shut the door down because it was over capacity," not because of any personal beef. At that time, about 200 people were said to be causing a "chaotic scene" outside, trying to get to the door.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52674058.jpg><p>The publication revealed that "Kylie was a welcome VIP and waited to be escorted into the bash through a side door — but she got out of her car before organizers were ready for her arrival." A source verified the claim, saying: "She prematurely got out of her car. Then she decided to go home because she didn't want to be at a crowded party. She rarely goes to clubs."</p><p>As for Kylie's clubbing record, the reality star famously broke social distancing protocols in 2020 to go clubbing with her friends on a Sunday night. It was days before Los Angeles County's scheduled reopening. The influencer was called out for such a tone-deaf gesture amid the height of Black Lives Matter protests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-out-celebrities-that-are-banned-from-the-met-gala>Check Out Celebrities That Are Banned From the Met Gala</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Facts Might Challenge The Kylie Jenner Timothée Chalamet Rumors</a></span></p><h2 id=janelle-monae-was-also-turned-away-from-doja-cat-39-s-met-gala-party>Janelle Monae Was Also Turned Away From Doja Cat's Met Gala Party</h2><p>Kylie wasn't the only famous personality blocked from Doja's Met Gala party. Glass Onion star, Janelle Monae was seen being turned away, alongside Gossip Girl actor, Evan Mock. "The door was rushed by crowds many times," an insider said of the overcapacity issues.</p><p>Page Six added that "the cops even showed up at one point and did not go inside, but rather helped manage the crowds and keep the street clear." Then by "6 a.m., a line of limos and SUVs were down the street," said another witness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52674685.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie wasn't really snubbed by Doja, as many assumed. One even tweeted about the incident, "Sorry, but this is so funny," with another confessing, "I love this. It finally means the girls are going down." Interestingly, in January 2023, the two celebrities also went viral after wearing dramatic outfits at the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show.</p><p>The Life of Kylie alum stepped out in a black dress with a giant lion's head on her chest while the Woman hitmaker wore an all-red ensemble that covered even her entire head, neck, and arms in glitter. PETA weighed in on their fashion choices, saying: "Kylie, Naomi and Irina [Shayk]'s looks celebrate the beauty of wild animals and may be a statement against trophy hunting, in which lions and wolves are torn apart to satisfy human egotism."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiisqSZmnqrsc2nnKtlkaOxbrDOo5hmm5GperOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIydnK2ZmaHAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./monica-ruiz-peloton-wife-actress-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monica Ruiz (Peloton Wife Actress) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr;
