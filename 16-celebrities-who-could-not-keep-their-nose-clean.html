Sure, you have a ton of money, but for these celebrities, they just shoved that up their noses. In fact, some of our candidates literally spent millions getting their fix&nbsp;over the years. You're also famous, which means that your every move is probably going to be watched by the paparazzi. As you'll see by the several candidates who had their bad&nbsp;habits get caught by the cameras.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll be amazed as we cover perhaps the 16 biggest celebrities who have ever openly admitted their addiction to snow. You know what we're talking about! Nose nachos, power powder, flour, the white alligator (...okay we made the last one up). The substance&nbsp;goes by many names but it is definitely one of the most serious ones out there.</p><p>It's hard to decide who is the biggest candidate, but we assure you they all have their entertaining (or depressing) stories to tell. Ranging from Steven Tyler who said he smoked half of Peru&nbsp;or Demi Lovato who admitted needing the drug every 30 minutes, to John Belushi who used to do copious amounts of the powder with Robin Williams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't think we've forgotten the modeling world where Kate Moss earned a nickname related to the drug or Cara Delevingne's incident with the paparazzi from 2013. Then, of course, we've also got actresses, including Jodie Sweeten who talks about doing some serious narcotics&nbsp;at an Olsen Film Festival and all the details on Angelina Jolie's former needs. And maybe you've heard that Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen like to party. You'll also learn how the drug impacted&nbsp;The Hangover!</p><p>Below Sheen says that getting hooked was his 3rd biggest regret.&nbsp;You can imagine for these other 16 celebrities, they probably would have agreed with him and probably chosen Coca-Cola or Pepsi instead!</p><h2 id=16-cara-delevingne---paparazzi-caught-her-in-2013><strong>16. Cara Delevingne - Paparazzi Caught Her In 2013</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Cara Delevingne</a> had herself a huge 2016 appearing in Suicide Squad. She was already one of the most successful models out there, winning Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 and 2014. Yet her life was far from all happiness, with&nbsp;a mother who battled an addiction to big H. When talking about the depression that she was feeling, Delevingne said, "I was hit with a massive wave of depression and anxiety and self-hatred, where the feelings were so painful that I would slam my head against a tree to try to knock myself out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And sadly that led to Delevigne abusing substances. In 2013, the photo seen above was taken of Delevingne trying to cover something that had fallen from her jacket as she tried to get home. The incident led to H&M dropping her as a client, but was not enough to severely hinder her career.</p><p>When talking about her struggles, <a href=#>Delevigne said</a> "'Honestly, I don’t think I did anything different from other people my age, but I definitely have that addict gene. For me, it comes out in an addiction to work. I’d probably have done more drugs back then if I hadn’t been working like mad."</p><p>We can only hope that her acting commitments will be enough to keep her busy!</p><p>Another fun fact of the Delevingne scandal: It led to Kate Moss dressing up as a drugged out Cara Delevingne for Halloween one year. Yikes! Not cool, especially when you learn more about Moss's addiction below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-robin-williams---calmed-him-down-stopped-after-belushi-died><strong>15. Robin Williams - Calmed Him Down, Stopped After Belushi Died</strong></h2><p>I don't know if there was ever a man in Hollywood that would be able to enter a scene with as much energy as <a href=#>Robin Williams</a>&nbsp;did. But while you may think that was due to his love of using some snow, you'd be wrong. In 1988, Williams said "For me was a place to hide. Most people get hyper on [the drug]. It slowed me down."</p><p>Belushi's death was a turning point in <a href=#>Williams' life.</a>&nbsp;"His death scared a whole group of show-business people. It caused a big exodus from drugs. And for me, there was the baby coming. I knew I couldn't be a father and live that sort of life," he said in a past interview.</p><p>Prior to quitting he admitted that there were several occasions where <a href=#>he was convinced he</a> was going to die because he took too much.</p><p>Williams stayed sober for 20 years, but addiction can always rear its ugly head and in 2006 Williams checked himself into rehab, this time spurred on by an addiction to alcohol. He stated that he did not get into narcotics&nbsp;again because he was convinced it would have killed him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-demi-lovato---couldn-t-go-more-than-30-minutes-without-it><strong>14. Demi Lovato - Couldn't Go More Than 30 Minutes Without It</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> made a name for herself on Barney and Friends, but there was definitely no lesson on there about how to smuggle drugs! That was something Lovato learned all by herself when she was actively fuelling an addiction. She has since been to rehab, but when talking to <a href=#>Access Hollywood Lovato admitted,</a></p><p>"I couldn’t go 30 minutes to an hour without [using] and I would bring it on airplanes. I would smuggle it basically and just wait until everyone in first class would go to sleep and I would do it right there. I’d sneak to the bathroom and I’d do it. That’s how difficult it got and that was even with somebody [with me], I had a sober companion, somebody who was watching me 24/7 and living with me [and] I was able to hide it from them as well.”</p><p>Lovato also explained her attitude prior to getting sober, <a href=#>saying to Refinery 29</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Prior to getting sober, I was one of those people who was like, I don’t give a f**k, whatever. And I used that as an excuse to do whatever I wanted. I was a nightmare to work with.”</p><p>Lovato hit rock bottom when she was 19 years old and went on a flight with a Sprite bottle full of straight vodka. The photo above was taken in 2011 shortly after Lovato left rehab for the 2nd time.</p><h2 id=13-steve-o-mike-tyson---did-it-together-for-several-hours><strong>13. Steve-O/Mike Tyson - Did It Together For Several Hours</strong></h2><p>When you consider what both of these men have done for a living, you can probably be at least a little bit more understanding that they both also have a pretty active history with drug use. But while we could get into that, instead we're going to talk about the hilarious time when <a href=#>Steve-O</a> arrived at a party. Knocking on the door, who else answers but <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a>! Steve-O was allegedly granted entry after telling Mike he had an eight ball in one pocket and half an eight ball in the other, which they then proceeded to go through over the course of a few hours while sitting in the bathroom!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike Tyson also opened up in a past interview with Graham Bensinger that he was doing rampant amounts of the substance&nbsp;while filming The Hangover, to the point where his voice was super nasally.</p><p>For Steve-O, <a href=#>his lowest moment as</a> an addict came when his former dealer sold him&nbsp;powder that he said was mixed with blood.</p><h2 id=12-angelina-jolie---did-everything-imaginable><strong>12. Angelina Jolie - Did Everything Imaginable</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> has definitely not shied away from her past, once saying “I’ve done just about every drug possible. Snow, big H.... LSD, everything. The worst effect, for me, was pot. I felt silly and giggly, and I hate feeling like that."</p><p>One of her former dealers reached out to RadarOnline where he also admitted that Jolie bought from him&nbsp;on a weekly basis,<a href=#> but also added</a>, “Keep in mind she just sniffed, as far as I know she didn’t smoke or shoot or do anything like that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie has since been able to clean up her act, and in 2011 <a href=#>( now awkward in hindsight) said</a> "I'm still a bad girl, I still have that side of me...It's just in its place now...it belongs to Brad. Or...our adventures."</p><h2 id=11-carrie-fisher---used-during-filming-of-empire><strong>11. Carrie Fisher - Used&nbsp;During Filming of Empire</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a> didn't have to take part in the Star Wars franchise to get to a galaxy far far away, she just had to do some partying! This led to some people theorizing that she was struggling with depression when filming The&nbsp;Empire Strikes Back, but in 2015 Fisher opened up about her experiences saying, "No, I didn’t go through a difficult time! I said I did blow a couple of times. That’s not a difficult time!”</p><p>Fisher was able to realize that she had a problem, saying "Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter. We did [it] on the set of Empire, in the ice planet [the second film of the original trilogy]. I didn't even like [snow] that much, it was just a case of getting on whatever train I needed to take to get high."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looks like that really was the snowiest planet! Her openness with her use during filming has also led to fans talking about the screencap that shows her with what appears to be a 'drug nail' for Return Of The Jedi.</p><p>Fisher denied that it was kept that way for drug use taking to Twitter to say "I never used my fingernail for drugs. I used dollars and tiny spoons like any other respectable former addict."</p><h2 id=10-lindsay-lohan---openly-did-it-off-of-her-wrist><strong>10. Lindsay Lohan - Openly Did It Off Of Her Wrist</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> on a list like this? Wait, seriously? Yes! We aren't pulling your leg, as this girl loves to get her party on. Apparently Lohan's use was limited, as she claimed&nbsp;she had used it "Maybe four or five times in [her]&nbsp;life," when talking to <a href=#>Piers Morgan</a> in 2013.</p><p>Oh, really Lohan? Let's <a href=#>break down</a> some moments in her life that she definitely had some lines added to her night. In 2006, Lohan overdosed on what was allegedly a mix of powder and painkillers, it led to time in rehab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After leaving rehab in 2007, Lohan crashed her car and it was found she had some of the drug in her bloodstream. That same year when she was arrested in July, she also happened to have power powder in her pocket.</p><p>In 2009, consumed&nbsp;some of it in front of blogger Nik Richie who wrote about it saying "Lindsay goes straight for the toilet, pulling her dress up and sitting (no underwear) and one of her breasts is hanging out the top of the dress. I start to wash my hands and she asks me, ‘So, what’s your story?’ before doing an uneven line of [snow] off her wrist." That same night Lohan and her partner Sam Rosen got into a fight that caused $13,000 worth of damage.</p><p>There was also the time she decided partying in France was more important than a court date. Something that went over great when photos were taken of her partying in front of a table with a bunch of white powder on&nbsp;it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-robert-downey-jr---was-arrested-several-times-almost-lost-career><strong>9. Robert Downey Jr. - Was Arrested Several Times, Almost Lost Career</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Robert Downey Jr</a>. may be Iron Man now, but you better believe he wished he had the whole Avengers team by his side when he was battling his extreme addiction to drugs and alcohol. This included multiple arrests, including Downey Jr. explaining his addiction to a judge saying, "It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth with my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal."</p><p>One of his more notable arrests came in 1996 when he was in possession of big H, snow, and an unloaded .357 magnum. His addictions cost him several jobs including what could have been a bigger role on&nbsp;Ally McBeal,&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;America's Sweethearts&nbsp;(which went to Billy Crystal), and a Mel Gibson stage production of&nbsp;Hamlet.&nbsp;</p><p>When talking to RollingStone about his addiction and how it spiraled, Downey Jr. said,&nbsp;"All those years of snorting [snow], and then I accidentally get involved in Big H after smoking rock for the first time. It finally tied my shoelaces together. You are rendered defenseless."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-jodie-sweetin---would-lie-there-thinking-she-was-dying-didn-t-care><strong>8. Jodie Sweetin - Would Lie There Thinking She Was Dying, Didn't Care</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jodie Sweetin</a> may have been able to turn her life around, but at the age of 13 she was going through a major crisis when&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;ended. Left not knowing where to go in life, Sweetin turned to a life of excess.</p><p>"Drugs and alcohol just sort of numbed everything. I was doing [snow], and ecstasy, and alcohol, and all that. The darkest moments for me weren't necessarily ending up in the hospital and all that. It was those quiet moments alone when I'd just hated the person I'd become," she said in a past interview.</p><p>While it was primarily ecstasy in high school, Sweetin admitted that the drug was huge in <a href=#>her college years, saying</a> "I wanted to prove that I could get more trashed than anyone. There were times I did so much coke, I'd be there laying there, getting sick and thinking 'I'm going to die.' But I didn't care."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweetin has two children, and like many people on here, that was a turning point for her but only after she drove drunk with her daughter in the car. Afterwards she said, "That was the big rock bottom. I had two glasses of wine and drove with her in the car. I not only put myself in danger, but also my daughter, who I loved more than anything. I felt terrible."</p><p>Sweetin also appeared in an interview with&nbsp;Good Morning America and People&nbsp;in 2008 in which she talked about her sobriety, but later admitted that she lied and was still using.</p><p>Sweetin has fortunately since been able to turn her life around appearing in the Netflix reboot&nbsp;Fuller House,&nbsp;as well as on season 22 of&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=7-david-bowie---diet-was-milk-powder-and-red-peppers><strong>7. David Bowie - Diet Was Milk, Powder, and Red Peppers</strong></h2><p>Every celebrity on this list would probably have said at one point or another that they loved using, but <a href=#>Bowie</a> is the only one on here who literally referred to it as his soulmate. Bowie was shoveling it in most prominently throughout the 70s during which he would stay up for days at a time. It was also in the 70s that Bowie overdosed several times due to his addictions. When performing as his Thin White Duke Persona, Bowie's diet allegedly only consisted of milk, powder, and red peppers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His record producer Tony Visconti talked more about that time of his life, saying "We did mountains of [it], it looked like the Matterhorn, obscenely big, and four open bottles of cognac.”</p><p>Bowie kicked a large majority of his vices&nbsp;by the mid-eighties, a decision that was helped by his move outside of America.</p><h2 id=6-wendy-williams---said-watching-her-was-like-a-circus-freak-show><strong>6. Wendy Williams - Said Watching Her Was Like a Circus Freak Show</strong></h2><p>There is nobody out there who can deny that <a href=#>Wendy Williams</a> is a busy woman. She made a name for herself as a radio DJ, which then led to her own reality TV series&nbsp;The Wendy Williams Experience&nbsp;which aired in 2006. Since then she has been the creator and host of&nbsp;The Wendy Williams Show,&nbsp;an infotainment talk show that has run for over 1,300 episodes since 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to her big move to television though, Williams is a self-admitted <a href=#>former addict, explaining&nbsp;</a>"I was a functioning addict. I’d work from 3 in the afternoon until 7 at night, get off and party until 7 in the morning — then sleep until 2, go to the radio station and do it all over again. People around me knew, but nobody ever said anything to me. Nobody had the guts, which is shocking to me. I guess it was like watching a circus freak show.”</p><p>You can hope that part of what helped her clean up her act was giving birth to her son on August 18th, 2000.</p><h2 id=5-kate-moss---did-three-grams-per-sitting><strong>5. Kate Moss - Did Three Grams Per&nbsp;Sitting</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Kate Moss</a> was making a name for herself as a model in the early 1990s, she was known for her size zero fashion and a prime example of "Heroin chic" which was marked by dark red lipstick, pale skin, dark circles under the eyes and angular bone structure.</p><p>Moss has been named one of the sexiest women in the world, but her life is far from all positives. In 2005, a tabloid newspaper ran an image of what appeared to be Moss snorting some nose powder. Her decision was a costly one, as shortly after Chanel and Burberry dropped her from their label. They were not alone, H&M also cut ties with her which cost her $4 million a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That being said, she was able to bounce back and for Autumn-Winter 2006, she booked 18 contracts (including Burberry again!).</p><p>It was reported in the book Champagne Supernovas that Moss would consume&nbsp;three grams of the drug &nbsp;in one sitting, as well as slam back a bottle of Vodka. Not afraid to show off her wealth, she loved using rolled up $100 bills!</p><p>Moss allegedly got involved with narcotics after her relationship with <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> ended in 1994. It's explained&nbsp;in the book, "Johnny broke her heart. She went mad. She was spinning out of control on drugs - big H and booze. ‘She just wouldn’t stop with the drugs and the drinking.”</p><h2 id=4-steven-tyler---spent-millions-alongside-bandmate-joe-perry><strong>4. Steven Tyler - Spent Millions Alongside Bandmate Joe Perry</strong></h2><p>Aerosmith is one of the most legendary rock and roll bands of all time. But you know what is even more legendary? Perhaps <a href=#>Steven Tyler</a>'s insane habits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking to&nbsp;Australia's&nbsp;60 Minutes,&nbsp;Tyler admitted "I spent five or six million dollars. But it doesn’t matter. You also could say I snorted half of Peru, but it doesn’t matter. You know, it’s what we did.”</p><p>His love of drugs earned him and bandmate <a href=#>Joe Perry</a> the nickname the 'Toxic Twins'. In Tyler's memoir&nbsp;Does The Noise In My Head Bother You,&nbsp;he also wrote about how they'd manage to do drugs while still rocking out, saying “Joe [Perry] had vials of [it] with straws in them at the back of the stage, and when the lights would go out he’d go over there like he was checking something or making a guitar change and [a roadie] would put the straw in his nose; he’d take a hit, then the lights would come on again.”</p><p>There was a potential album that was supposed to come out around 2010, but Tyler admitted that drugs played a huge factor in it not coming together, saying&nbsp;"Joe was high and he couldn't play, I couldn't sing, really, because I was snorting everything, and it f--ks up your throat. It was the wrong time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about his addictions to Matt Lauer, <a href=#>Tyler admitted</a> "I needed [to use] I needed it. It took my children away, it took my marriages away. I was on my knees."</p><p>Tyler has been able to clean his life up, but it was not without at least 8 trips to rehab over the years.</p><h2 id=3-flavor-flav---spent-5-6-million-over-6-years-on-it><strong>3. Flavor Flav - Spent $5.6 Million Over 6 Years On It</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Flavor Flav</a> has found success as both a musician, comedian, actor and has been the host of several reality shows. He also has the fun distinction of finding success as being our last candidate who did not lose their life, and trust us, he deserves it.</p><p>In his memoir&nbsp;Flavor Flav: The Icon,&nbsp;Flav admitted that he spent $2,600 a day, every day, for 6 years to support his addiction to powder. This works out to a total of $5,696,600, but at least to <a href=#>Flav's credit, he said,</a>&nbsp;"I went through a lot of money. If I did the math I’d probably be shocked on how much money I spent, I’d probably punch myself in the face. I’d probably be shocked on how much money I spent, I’d probably punch myself in the face." So at least he knows it was ridiculous!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flav turned away from drugs in 2003 when he moved to California to pursue acting, saying "I didn’t want to build a bad reputation in other states. I wanted to leave all that stuff in New York. That’s what really helped me get clean by me not wanting to build up a reputation of me going through neighborhoods buying drugs."</p><h2 id=3-charlie-sheen---spent-1-500-a-day-on-powder-15-000-a-month-on-girls><strong>3. Charlie Sheen - Spent $1,500 a Day on Powder, $15,000 a Month on Girls</strong></h2><p>If we are going to start talking about all the stories involving<a href=#> Charlie Sheen</a> we could be here all day. But how about we start with the fact that an insider said of Sheen's house, "There was drugs everywhere - take your choice - there was [snow], there's marijuana... He's got any drug you want and if he doesn't have the drug he can make one phone call and he can get it."</p><p>When talking to RadarOnline about his past regrets, Sheen listed the drug as his 3rd biggest behind starting smoking and getting tattoos. While he claims he never overdosed, he also admitted that he came very close, referring to a 1998 incident that led him to rehab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheen has also admitted to spending over $1,500 a day on snow and at least $15,000 a month on call girls. The women were also one of Sheen's biggest pleasures, and all women were forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement, leave their cellphones at the door and then were allowed to enter.</p><p>Sheen has said in the past that he feels lucky to be alive, let's hope he doesn't keep squandering that gift!</p><h2 id=2-mitch-hedberg---died-12-days-after-saying-he-had-it-under-control><strong>2. Mitch Hedberg - Died 12 Days After Saying He Had It Under Control</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mitch Hedberg</a> was one of the greatest stand-up comedians of all time, and while his comedy routines heavily involved drug-related humor, it was all the sadder when he passed away due to an overdose in 2005. An autopsy found several substances&nbsp;in his system.</p><p>Hedberg battled addiction issues throughout his career, but his genius was still well-recognized and in 2000 Time magazine named him most likely to become the next Jerry Seinfeld. Hedberg's death is made all the sadder by the fact that 12 days prior he appeared on The Howard Stern Show saying, "Well, you know, I got the drugs under control now....[I can take them responsibly] just for the creative side of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps alongside being hilarious, Hedberg was also able to see the future. When he was asked in 2001 about how he wanted to die, he responded "First, I'd want to get famous, and then I'd overdose. If I overdosed at this stage in my career, I would be lucky if it made the back pages."</p><h2 id=1-john-belushi---had-a-snow-budget-on-the-blues-brothers><strong>1. John Belushi - Had a 'Snow Budget' On The Blues Brothers</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Belushi</a>&nbsp;was one of the funniest comedians of all time.&nbsp;Whether it&nbsp;was for his time on the big screen or Saturday Night Live, he often knew how to leave your gut hurting from laughing so hard. But he would then proceed to make his nose hurt from partying so hard! One of his favorite games included laying down an ounce of powder into one big line and then racing someone else to see who could get to the middle.&nbsp;Allegedly the game was called "[powder] chicken" and Belushi was quite good.</p><p>His addiction got to the extent that when making The Blues Brothers in 1980, there was literally a budget for the drug.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Dan Aykroyd</a> opened up about Belushi's experience, saying "Everyone did it, including me. Never to excess, and not ever to where I wanted to buy it or have it. [But] John, he just loved what it did. It sort of brought him alive at night -- that superpower feeling where you start to talk and converse and figure you can solve all the world’s problems."</p><p>At one point during filming, Belushi allegedly wandered off and appeared asleep in a stranger's house who lived by the set.</p><p>Belushi died at the age of 33 from a drug overdose after partying all night with a speedball of snow and big H. Both Robin Williams and <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> were with Belushi that night&nbsp;but had left earlier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5lk5q5pq7RoquinaNixKm7jJymrqSUYruwwIyknJ6oXam1prXRZqWoq5VisK2xwKdm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beth-phoenix-recalls-her-most-memorable-crowd-reaction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beth Phoenix Recalls Her Most Memorable Crowd Reaction">&larr;
