Most notably, West said that fentanyl, and not being suffocated by a police officer’s knee, caused Floyd’s death, per <a href=#><i>Rolling Stone.</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I watched the George Floyd documentary that Candace Owens put out. One of the things that his two roommates said was they want a tall guy like me, and the day that he died, he said a prayer for eight minutes,” West told Drink Champs. “They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that.”</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Kanye West’s Bank JP Morgan Has Cut Ties With Him</b></a></span></p><p>(During the trial against Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin, medical experts testified that even though Floyd had traces of fentanyl in his system, Floyd died from a lack of oxygen caused by the knee on his neck, which a coroners’ report affirmed in deeming Floyd’s death a homicide.)</p><p>On Sunday (Oct 16), civil rights attorney and attorney for George Floyd’s family, Lee Merrit, confirmed a lawsuit could be on the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the Drink Champs episode, Kanye West incorrectly stated that George Floyd died from taking fentanyl. “I watched the George Floyd documentary that Candace Owens put out… They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that,” Ye said.</p><p>Floyd was killed in 2020 after Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for over nine minutes. While it was determined Floyd had a trace amount of fentanyl in his system, a coroner and medical experts confirmed it was Chauvin’s knee cutting off his oxygen supply that killed him. Chauvin was later convicted of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison, according to <a href=#><i>AllHipHop</i>.</a></p><p>Merritt continued: “Claiming Floyd died from fentanyl not the brutality established criminally and civilly undermines & diminishes the Floyd family’s fight.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye West made his comments after attending the premier of “Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM.” The documentary was made by controversial conservative commentator and vocal “Black Lives Matter” critic Candace Owens.</p><p>Elsewhere during his Drink Champs interview, Kanye discussed his controversial “White Lives Matter” design. He also spoke on the antisemitic comments that resulted in his social media suspensions.</p><p>As reported by <a href=#><i>Complex</i>,</a> Former NBA player Stephen Jackson slammed Kanye West for his comments about George Floyd.</p><p>During an appearance on the latest episode of Drink Champs, Ye incorrectly claimed that Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose. “If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that,” Kanye said, referring to ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd.</p><p>Jackson took to Instagram on Sunday to rip Kanye’s remarks as “clout chasing.” The All The Smoke host posted a short clip in which he indirectly criticizes West, among others, for taking advantage of Floyd’s death by “dissing” him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s all noted,” he captioned the clip. “To say u a Legend in music @kanyewest it’s sad that u still gotta talk about other people lives to be relevant is wack. Its really sad u doing all this over some ‘Pussy.’ Tender dick ass n***a.”</p><p>Jackson isn’t the only one who called out Kanye speaking about Floyd.</p><p>Boosie Badazz also hopped on social media Sunday to blast West in a pair of tweets.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Tekashi 6ix9ine Allegedly Disappeared And Hasn’t Paid His Lawyers For Months</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, <a href=#>AllHipHop</a>, <a href=#>Complex</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0prvRoJxmnpykxqW%2FjJ%2BYpqGcrnqiuMuenp6cnK56tMHEnWSkmZ6usm7DxKyrZp6fp3qkuMCipKKml2KzrbvYnWSdoZWZerCyjJ%2Bcp6yRo8atew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hilaria-baldwin-on-relationship-with-stepdaughter-ireland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilaria Baldwin on Relationship With Stepdaughter Ireland">&larr;
