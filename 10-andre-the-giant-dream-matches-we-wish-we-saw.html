Known for his gigantic size, Andre was a larger than life figure, and his colossal size made him an unstoppable force.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p dir=ltr><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Reasons Andr√© The Giant Is The Best Giant In Wrestling History (& 5 Why It's The Big Show)</a></span></p><p>Standing tall at 7 feet 4 inches, Andre weighed over five hundred pounds. His superior size advantage helped him to stay undefeated for thirteen years, his initial years in WWE. Andre also won the WWE Championship once, and mainevented WrestleMania 3 against Hulk Hogan. Unfortunately, Andre passed away in 1993. Let's take a look at ten Andre the Giant dream matches we wish we saw.</p><h2 id=john-cena><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>John Cena</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/John-Cena-Cropped-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Cena</a>, the sixteen-time WWE Champion, came to the picture in 2002, nine years after the death of Andre the Giant. The leader of Cenation eventually became the face of WWE, conquering everything on his path. With that being said, Cena would have been a great opponent for Andre the Giant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Best John Cena "You Can't See Me" Memes</a></span></p><p>Cena is recognized for his incredible strength, and he has done some insurmountable tasks in the ring. Cena is certainly capable of matching the power of Andre the Giant. An AA to Andre the Giant would have made the match exciting.</p><h2 id=braun-strowman><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Braun Strowman</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/braun-strowman-2.jpg><p>Given the current pool of wrestlers in <a href=#>WWE</a>, not many Superstars have huge sizes. Braun Strowman, the Monster among Men, is one of the few full-time Superstars with a colossal stature. Billed at six feet eight inches, Strowman is not only very tall but also agile for his size, making him a dream opponent for Andre the Giant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Andre the Giant and Strowman had a dream match, it would have been nothing short of spectacular. Both men would try their best to outshine each other, but Andre the Giant should be the favorite to win the bout.</p><h2 id=batista><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Batista</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Batista-1.jpg><p>Weighing over three hundred pounds, Batista was a monster at his peak, when he made his WWE debut in 2002. The six-time WWE Champion wrecked every single Superstar on his path, becoming one of the biggest Superstars in the Ruthless Aggression Era. With a well-built physique, Batista was also one of the strongest men in WWE.</p><p>Batista had a proven track record of delivering impressive matches against giants. The Animal manhandled Superstars like Big Show, The Great Khali, and Mark Henry in the past, and hence, Andre the Giant would not have been any different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brock-lesnar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Brock Lesnar</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/https___specials-images.forbesimg.com_imageserve_5d985a2c67dd830006a2c018_0x0.jpg><p>Watching The Beast and The Giant collide in the WWE ring would be in the bucket list of every wrestling fan, and it should be one of the biggest dream matches for Andre the Giant. Brock Lesnar, the current WWE Champion, is an intimidating man, who loves to sabotage his opponent. Andre the Giant, meanwhile, did the same thing, when he was in WWE, making it a 'Clash of Titans'.</p><p>Known for his brutal strength, Lesnar is capable of tossing up big men. The unforgettable incident from 2003 should be a notable mention, as he broke the ring while Superplexing Big Show. Perhaps Lesnar could have done the same thing with Andre the Giant, had he faced the latter in a dream match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stone-cold-steve-austin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Stone Cold Steve Austin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Steve-Austin-3188.jpg><p>Well, Stone Cold Steve Austin might not be a giant himself, but he could have delivered a great match against someone like Andre the Giant. Stone Cold was the biggest draw in the Attitude Era. Andre the Giant, on the other hand, was one of the biggest draws of his era, making it a perfect dream match for the fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Wrestlers Other Wrestlers Feared</a></span></p><p>Austin was competent in producing noteworthy matches against bigger opponents. Imagine a larger than life figure like Andre the Giant getting stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin. It would have been a match to main event WrestleMania.</p><h2 id=kane><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kane</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/001_1999_sKANE_08281999_0002-c6e52a8bf60a393f29d16596f0b3ab5c.jpg><p>WWE has had many gigantic Superstars, and Kane was certainly one of them, especially when he made his debut as the Big Red Machine in 1997. With a frightening mask combining with his tall stature, Kane would have been a perfect dream opponent for Andre the Giant.</p><p>When Kane made his debut in WWE, he was terrifying. Not only was he swift and powerful in the ring, but his dark persona also had a different aura, making him a fan favorite. Kane produced several great matches with other big men, and it would not have been different against Andre the Giant.</p><h2 id=goldberg><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Goldberg</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/goldberg-2020-02-27c.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably one of the powerful men in the history of professional wrestling, Goldberg could be an ideal choice for someone like Andre the Giant. With his raw power and agility in between the ropes, Goldberg was a monster in his prime, dismantling every opponent within a few minutes. The WCW legend also held an unbeaten streak, similar to Andre the Giant's undefeated streak in the earlier part of his career.</p><p>Goldberg fought some big men in his prime. Showing impressive strength in the ring, Goldberg delivered a remarkable Jackhammer to Big Show, which was one of the best Jackhammers ever. A similar Jackhammer to Andre the Giant would have stolen the show had Goldberg faced Andre in a dream match.</p><h2 id=the-undertaker><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1522493671-undertaker-wrestlemania-33-1-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kane's brother, The <a href=#>Undertaker</a>, has a similar gigantic size, making him a suitable opponent to have a dream match with Andre the Giant. Moreover, Phenom is one of the greatest names to ever grace the ring, and a match between The Undertaker and Andre the Giant would have been an ultimate dream match for the fans.</p><p>The Deadman has been wrestling for thirty years. Although he has slowed down in recent years, he was an exceptional performer in his prime. The blockbuster match would have been a once in a lifetime encounter for the avid wrestling fans.</p><h2 id=the-great-khali><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Great Khali</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Andre the Giant was one of the tallest men in WWE, The Great Khali wasn't far away. The former World Heavyweight Champion had a monumental size, and he terrorized everyone after making his debut. He not only beat The Undertaker but also ascended the top of the ladder by winning the World Heavyweight Title.</p><p>While Khali wasn't a noteworthy performer, the match would still be a fantasy match, considering how big both men were in the ring. The match between two behemoths would be a competition of both size and strength.</p><h2 id=big-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Big Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wwe-big-show-paul-wight-return.jpg><p>If the world's largest athlete collides with the largest athlete of the past, it should tear the house down. Big Show was known for his monumental size, when he was at his prime, helping him to dominate WWE as well as WCW. Due to his gigantic size, Big Show was known The Giant in WCW, who was the son of Andre the Giant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similar to Andre the Giant, Big Show was also nearly five hundred pounds in the initial years of his career. Furthermore, Big Show stands tall over seven feet. Sadly, the fans will never see the two giants fight in the ring.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> 10 Wrestlers Who Should Retire Big Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnkaOxs7GMoKCapqRisbOxwKZkppmkmLWmv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-highest-paid-hedge-fund-managers-2011.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Highest-Paid Hedge Fund Managers 2011">&larr;
