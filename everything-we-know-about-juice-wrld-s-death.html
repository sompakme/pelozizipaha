Born Jarad Anthony Higgins, the <a href=#>Chicago rapper</a> was known for his hit “Lucid Dreams,” which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the biggest streaming hits of 2018. He collaborated with Travis Scott on Astroworld, contributed to the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack, and collaborated with <a href=#>BTS’s RM and Suga</a>. Juice WRLD wasn’t just rising, he was skyrocketing. His untimely death has <a href=#>shaken music fans everywhere</a>, but the details that have been revealed since are even more baffling. After federal agents revealed they were searching his plane for contraband, sources are suggesting Juice WRLD took “several” Percocet pills to hide them from authorities, leading to his emergency. Here’s what we actually know about Juice WRLD’s sudden death.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck408tpfz000u3a67c4dk6hqt@published data-word-count=46><strong>When did Juice WRLD die?</strong><br>Juice WRLD was <a href=#>pronounced dead</a> at around 3:15 a.m. on December 8 at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois. He had been transferred from Chicago Midway International Airport after suffering from a “medical emergency” upon landing in Chicago from California.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck408tpmw000w3a67tlncspcf@published data-word-count=62><strong>How did Juice WRLD die?</strong><br>On January 22, over a month after his death, Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office <a href=#>determined</a> that Juice WRLD’s death was caused by an accidental overdose of oxycodone and codeine. His official cause of death was not initially determined, as additional toxicology, cardiac pathology, and neuropathology tests were required following an initial autopsy on the Monday after his death.<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5pt9r9l000z3b67u8on0c5d@published data-word-count=63>His “medical emergency” was initially described as a seizure and a heart attack. According to <a href=#>the Chicago police</a>, Juice WRLD went into convulsions as federal agents searched the private jet he arrived in. A federal agent administered the <a href=#>opioid antidote Narcan</a>. Juice WRLD woke up incoherent briefly and TMZ reported that paramedics spent 40 minutes treating the rapper, attempting to steady his heartbeat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck408tppl000y3a67r7vmfbjk@published data-word-count=91><strong>Did Juice WRLD overdose?</strong><br>TMZ’s law-enforcement sources allege that Juice WRLD swallowed multiple Percocet pills in order to hide them from federal agents. One of the rapper’s associates told local law enforcement that Juice WRLD took “several unknown pills” before his medical emergency, adding that the 21-year-old had allegedly recently become addicted to Percocet. Juice WRLD has been open with his struggles with drug addiction. In July, he tweeted that he would <a href=#>stop abusing codeine</a> for his girlfriend’s sake. His official cause of death was a result of oxycodone and codeine toxicity.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck408tq5c00103a67vpty93z5@published data-word-count=124><strong>Why were the Feds searching Juice WRLD?</strong><br>Federal agents and officers were waiting for Juice WRLD’s private plane to arrive at the Chicago airport “<a href=#>because they suspected</a>” that they would find contraband material. According to TMZ, the pilot had <a href=#>alerted authorities</a> because members of Juice WRLD’s entourage had guns on them. Over 70 pounds of vacuum-sealed marijuana, “six bottles of prescription codeine cough syrup, two 9 mm pistols, a .40-caliber pistol, a high-capacity ammunition magazine and metal-piercing bullet” were found on the plane. <a href=#>TMZ</a> also reported that Juice WRLD was initially searched by federal agents while leaving the country for Australia from Los Angeles on November 18. It’s unclear if anything was found, but Juice WRLD and his entourage were allowed to make the journey.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4487qkj002e3h67csjvdn1s@published data-word-count=78><strong>Did the police arrest Juice WRLD’s entourage?</strong><br>Two of his bodyguards were arrested for gun possession, but one was released without bail and the other posted bond. The Chicago PD has <a href=#>taken over</a> the marijuana investigation and no charges have been filed as of press time. TMZ <a href=#>reported</a> that it’s unlikely the drug bust will result in any charges. No one on the plane is admitting to owning the 70 pounds of marijuana and there are no identifying features.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck42s0p5h00183h676u72a8bq@published data-word-count=129><strong>Does this have anything to do with Juice WRLD’s 2018 arrest at La Guardia Airport?</strong><br>Friends and supporters have suggested that Juice WRLD’s death was part of a larger pattern of racial profiling at airports. They cited his 2018 arrest at La Guardia Airport in New York City. TMZ’s law-enforcement sources maintain that <a href=#>it was a standard procedure</a>. Juice WRLD’s checked luggage went through the X-ray scanner and set off alarms for organic material that could be used to make a bomb. Instead, they allegedly found codeine and over two ounces of marijuana. Police confirmed the contents and arrested Juice WRLD, who was already aboard his flight, after he admitted the items were his. The rapper was charged with misdemeanor possession, but eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser, noncriminal charge.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck42rrim300123h673y84g1kc@published data-word-count=66><strong>What has Juice WRLD’s family said about his death?</strong><br>In a statement to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Juice WRLD’s mother, Carmella Wallace, expressed her grief and acknowledged his battle with drug dependency. “We loved Jarad with all of our hearts and cannot believe our time with him has been cut short,” she said. “As he often addressed in his music and to his fans, Jarad battled with prescription drug dependency.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck40b59t200433a67649mlvfh@published data-word-count=68>“Addiction knows no boundaries and its impact goes way beyond the person fighting it. Jarad was a son, brother, grandson, friend and so much more to so many people who wanted more than anything to see him defeat addiction,” she continued. “We hope the conversations he started in his music and his legacy will help others win their battles as that is what he wanted more than anything.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Grade A Productions (@gradea)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5qyp1pt000y3h67ye3kqv2c@published data-word-count=83>On January 22, after Juice WRLD’s official cause of death was released to the public, his family shared a statement on Instagram, thanking fans for their support and announcing that posthumous music is on the way. “We plan to honor Juice’s talents, his spirit, and the love he felt for his fans by sharing unreleased music and other projects that he was passionately in the process of developing,” they wrote. “There will be a public tribute in Chicago, details will be shared soon.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckxgohgzi000q3f6kk6p4vz0w@published data-word-count=133><strong>How did The Kid Laroi address Juice WRLD’s death?</strong><br>The Kid Laroi, a friend and collaborator of Juice WRLD’s who was on the rapper’s jet during his seizure and death, <a href=#>opened up</a> about the event for the first time in the HBO Max documentary Into the Abyss, released on December 16, 2021. The Tommy Oliver documentary, constructed from behind-the-scenes footage filmed throughout Juice WRLD’s rise, grimly showed the rapper’s consumption of pills and lean in detail. “He was so ill,” Laroi said of Juice WRLD hours before his death. “I was just sitting there panicking. I was like, ‘What the fuck?’” The musician, now 18, continued, “Then the police came over to us and handcuffed us all. They handcuffed us in a line and they were was like, ‘Get the fuck away from him!’”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rap by RAPTV (@rap)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck42s92iq001e3h67ijwxwy8z@published data-word-count=9>This post is being updated as new details emerge.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck4033ltg006kany61q7256ju@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>We’re Losing Another Rap Generation Right Before Our Eyes</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck3ynz2lt002bizy6zlq1xs2f@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Juice WRLD and a Legacy Cut Short</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjta450yl005aleyebqjrpcgr@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Juice WRLD Doesn’t Want to Be Emo Anymore</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Everything We Know About Juice WRLD’s Death</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdhZ3ypu9Zmm6KcXZ%2FCqq%2FEZq6lqpRisaqxjJyYrquVYrynecmuoJydXay%2FrbDSZpuemaSde6nAzKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fans-say-these-are-the-wildest-catfish-episodes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Say These Are The Wildest Catfish Episodes">&larr;
