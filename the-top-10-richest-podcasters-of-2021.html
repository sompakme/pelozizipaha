With many people working from home, and others abiding by the continual safer-at-home orders being issued, podcasters have become close friends with a diverse and <a href=#>growing audience of listeners</a>. This has resulted in a <a href=#>top 10 list</a> where no podcaster makes below $1 million annually.</p><p>The recent transitions of podcasters finding platforms specific to their content have also helped usher in the successful year. Joe Rogan made headlines when he announced his <a href=#>more than $100 million Spotify exclusive deal</a> in May of 2020. Spotify also announced several other exclusive podcast deals with stars including <a href=#>Addison Rae</a>, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, and former President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a>. Comedian and host Tim Dillon has utilized the <a href=#>Patreon platform</a> to release exclusive podcasts and content for his listeners who at $5 a month earn him an annual revenue of&nbsp;<a href=#>over $1.3 million</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=related-single>RELATED: The Number Of Hours Spotify Users Spent Listening To Podcasts Skyrocketed Last Year</span></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This list takes into consideration <a href=#>sponsorships</a>, <a href=#>affiliate marketing</a>, and <a href=#>the sales of accompanying products and services</a> to determine these podcasters' revenue. While some iconic programs have <a href=#>maintained their positions on the list</a> due to the sustainability of their production models, there are also several new additions featuring up and coming hosts, comedians, and journalists that have forged their way onto the list, showing the malleability of the modern medium.
