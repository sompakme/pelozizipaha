Whether it was central to the plot of an episode or simply an excuse to get the characters together to serve something unrelated, food played a massive role throughout all 10 seasons. So much so that lists have been created of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every meal consumed on the beloved sitcom</a>.

Unfortunately, there has not been a lot of information on this that's been made public. However, simply watching the show with an eye trained on the food reveals a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-10.jpg><p>Firstly, much of the food on Friends does appear to have been real. We know this because the actors are actually eating it on screen. However, not every time food is present in a scene does it get consumed. This is typical for movies and TV shows as it takes a long time to reset food between takes. Not to mention getting the continuity correct in the edit or simply making an actor way too full while they should be focusing on their lines and intentions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, when re-watching Friends, it's clear that the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc had to devour a few things, whether it was at a restaurant, muffins at Central Perk, pizza at Joey's, or a dinner at Monica's.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-scene-from-Friends-featuring-David-Schwimmer-Courteney-Cox-Matthew-Perry-Lisa-Kudrow-Matt-LeBlanc-and-Jennifer-Aniston-via-FilmAffinity.jpg><p>According to EveryMovieHasALesson, it's typical for actors not to fully consume all the real food on their plates. Due to having to shoot a scene multiple times, actors will often spit up their food into buckets so as not to eat too much. Specific angles as well as editing decisions are also utilized in order to make it look like an actor is actually eating when they are not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jane Sibbett Went Off The Script On Friends With Legitimate Tears During Her Scene With David Schwimmer</a></span></p><p>Typically, the props department works with resultant supply companies and chefs hired for the show in order to create and replenish the food in every scene.</p><p>However, prop food is also frequently used.

It also happens to contain some of the most quoted lines in the show's history. And this is mostly due to the trifle storyline which features an iconic and <a href=#>improvised line from David Schwimmer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Creators Of Friends Decided To Cut A Scene That Shows Joey Taking A Shot At Monica</a></span></p><p>In the Season 6 Episode 9 show, Jennifer Aniston's Rachel attempts to contribute to Thanksgiving dinner by making dessert. Only she ends up accidentally combining two polar opposite recipes (a trifle and a shepherd's pie) and creates nothing short of a monstrosity. The concoction consisted of ladyfingers, jam, custard (made from scratch), raspberries, more ladyfingers, beef sautéed with peas and onions, a little more custard, sliced bananas, and whipped cream. Of course, Matt LeBlanc's Joey is the only one who actually likes the taste. The rest placate Rachel so as not to hurt her feelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/friends-ross-rachel-and-joey.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While in some cases the food on sitcom sets is fake, this scene actually required the cast of Friends to eat something. Fortunately, the actors didn't have to consume such a revolting concoction. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview on The Graham Norton Show</a>, Matt LeBlanc revealed that the dessert the actors had to eat on set was mostly just whipped cream and bananas. Therefore, LeBlanc had no issue shoving it into his mouth...</p><p>It was months later that he learned that he was actually eating much more than whipped cream and bananas...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Producers On Friends Instantly Realized They Messed Up Bringing In Jean-Claude Van Damme Based On How He Was Memorizing His Lines</a></span></p><p>"So, [in the scene, David Schwimmer's] Ross is saying that he doesn't like it and Rachel hears and it hurts her feelings. And he doesn't want to hurt her feelings. So he eats the whole thing," Matt LeBlanc said to Graham Norton and the other guests on the 2018 show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But there's too much on [David's] plate. So, he starts to eat it all and he can't finish it and he starts laughing. So we cut. And as we were cutting, he kind of spits it back on his plate. And I'm sitting right next to him but I'm looking the other way. I didn't see him spit it back on his plate. So, [later] I take his plate and I say, 'Give it to me' and I scrape his plate on my plate and I say, 'hear, let's [film] again.' And then we go again and now I'm eating it...
