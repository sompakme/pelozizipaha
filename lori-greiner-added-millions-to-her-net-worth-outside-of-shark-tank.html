The Chicago, Illinois native was invited to join the television series in 2012, which is the same year that Mark Cuban also made his appearance on the show.</p><p>And, as one might imagine, Shark Tank pays its hosts a pretty penny per episode, but that's not the only stream of income Greiner used to build her incredible net worth. As a matter of fact, she was grossing millions long before she was even considered as one of the show's hosts.

Shortly after, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she went on to make over $1 million with her earring organizer</a>, and that figure only grew over the next few years.

This led to her having her own show, Clever & Unique Creations, in 2000, which then led to <a href=#>Greiner replacing Barbara Corcoran as one of the judges on ABC's Shark Tank in 2012.</a> According to Parade, she's making $50,000 per episode on the show, which works out to be $1.2 million per season (22 episodes). She joined the show in its 3rd Season, so she has been paid close to $10 million just to appear as a host on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from her base salary as a judge on the show, how much has Lori Grenier made from the private companies she invested in while on the show? One of those investments was in the cleaning sponge company, Scrub Daddy, which ended up being one of the biggest successes in Shark Tank history. Scrub Daddy raked in over $200 million in retail sales from 2014 to 2023, and Greiner's 20% equity stake in the company gives her a $9 million return from the profits. By 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her estimated earnings from the company had reached $40 million</a>, according to Equity Atlas.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-lori-greiner-make-from-her-company><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Does Lori Greiner Make From Her Company?</span></h2><h3 id=estimated-company-earnings-350-million>Estimated Company Earnings: $350 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lori-greiner-wearing-a-white-dress.jpg><p>As is to be expected, Lori Greiner has added much more to her net worth from her company, For Your Ease Only, and from her other patents than she has from her Shark Tank salary.

The show became an excellent platform to market her products, and by 2010, her brand pulled in an estimated $350 million in sales. Using the success of her company brand as an example, Greiner has also been a mentor to entrepreneurs, has been featured in publications such as Forbes, Financial Times, Success, and Entrepreneur to name a few. Her book, Invent It, Sell It, Bank It!: Make Your Million-Dollar Idea Into A Reality, was published in 2014 and made it to #3 on the Wall Street Journal's Bestseller list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-has-lori-greiner-made-from-other-shark-tank-business-investments><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Has Lori Greiner Made From Other Shark Tank Business Investments?</span></h2><h3 id=second-best-shark-tank-investment-squatty-potty>Second-best Shark Tank Investment: Squatty Potty</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/untitled-design-36-1.png><p>Aside from her highly lucrative stake in the Scrub Daddy company, Lori Greiner has made a few other shrewd investments in private companies through Shark Tank that have proved to work out in her favor.
