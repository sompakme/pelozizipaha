A great deal of her music is inspired by the men around her, and she has truly mastered how to transform life into art. The singer/songwriter has been ridiculed by the press and on social media for her constant rotation of men. Swift has thankfully been able to poke fun at the public’s view of her dating life through songs like Blank Space and I Did Something Bad, with society’s opinions no longer seeming to affect her.</p><p>Swift has dated all sorts of celebrities, from politicians to actors and musicians like herself. Though it seemed Swift was about to settle down with <a href=#>Joe Alwyn, that relationship came to a screeching halt in 2023</a>, meaning Swift is yet again a single woman looking to mingle...

Considering that Swifties thought Alwyn was "the one" for Swift, it came as quite a shock.</p><p>Since that time, Swift has been linked to singer, Matt Healy and NFL player, Travis Kelce. Given that Swift looks like she is having fun with her current rumored beau, Kelce, fans are happy for her. And the NFL is not complaining, <a href=#>with Swift's fans attending games just to catch a glimpse of the Lavender Haze singer</a> and her famous friends cheering Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs on.</p><h2 id=ex-boyfriend-joe-alwyn-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ex-Boyfriend Joe Alwyn's Net Worth</span></h2><h3 id=4-million>$4 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-alwyn-in-an-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The longest of all the relationships that Swift has been in was with Joe Alwyn. Swift and Alwyn were together for six years and fans thought that the two would get engaged sooner rather than later based on the lyrics of Swift's songs.</p><p>However, as a result of receiving media attention that Alwyn just did not want, a wedge formed in the relationship. Eventually, it came to an end without any drama but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because of personality differences</a>.</p><p>The relationship officially ran its course right at the start of Swift's Eras Tour.</p><p>Alwyn currently has a net worth of $4 million.</p><h2 id=ex-boyfriend-conor-kennedy-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ex-Boyfriend Conor Kennedy's Net Worth</span></h2><h3 id=10-million>$10 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50134879-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conor Kennedy is a member of the Kennedy political family. Taylor Swift and Conor Kennedy were initially linked after being spotted in July 2012 in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. A source told Us Weekly, “Conor put his arm around Taylor and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they kissed behind the boat shed</a>.” Their relationship was short-lived, however, as they reportedly split in September of the same year. Fans speculated that their time together was memorialized in Swift’s song ‘Begin Again,’ which was on the singer’s Red album and featured close-friend Ed Sheeran.</p><p>Kennedy is reportedly worth $10 million, which is the lowest net worth of Taylor Swift’s famous ex-boyfriends.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-matt-healy-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Much Is Matt Healy Worth?</span></h2><h3 id=15-million>$15 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matty-healy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The relationship between Swift and Matt Healy lasted only a month. However, the brief time the two were together was mired in controversy. This was because Healy made racist comments about Ice Spice's ethnicity on a podcast, putting Swifties up in arms. They hoped that Swift and Healy would go their separate ways and got their wish in June 2023.</p><p>The controversy did not seem to affect Healy's position as the lead singer of The 1975 or his net worth.
