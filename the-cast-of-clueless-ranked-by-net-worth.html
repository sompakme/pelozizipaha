You longed for&nbsp;a chunky cellphone&nbsp;and only somewhat jokingly uttered an "as if!" at your friends in feigned disbelief.&nbsp; The 1995 teen comedy starring Alicia Silverstone is a classic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mean Girls: The Main Characters' Real Life Ages & Relationship Statuses</a></span></p><p>Like&nbsp;Mean Girls or She's All That, Clueless had a big following&nbsp;that&nbsp;to this day still inspires Halloween costumes. If you're wondering what the former Baldwins and Bettys are up to, here is the cast of Clueless, ranked by net worth.</p><h2 id=stacey-dash---100-000>Stacey Dash - $100,000</h2><p>You may remember her as Murray's girlfriend and Cher's best friend, Dionne. Stacey Dash was born in the Bronx and made guest appearances on The Cosby Show and The Fresh Prince before she landed her most iconic role in the movie Clueless.</p><p>Dash went on to have a few other parts in movies and TV shows but made the most waves as a pundit on Fox News.&nbsp;Nowadays, her net worth is estimated to be around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elisa-donovan---4-million>Elisa Donovan - $4 Million</h2><p>Elisa Donovan is originally from Poughkeepsie, New York and played Cher's exquisitely snobbish and popularity-driven antagonist in Clueless. Her role as style-obsessed Amber was crucial in both the movie and the TV series that followed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Popstars Who Are Fashion Trendsetters</a></span></p><p>Donovan went on to play Morgan Cavanaugh for three seasons in yet another classic teen sitcom for young '90s viewers, Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Elisa Donovan has also starred in several well-known TV movies like, The Dog Who Saved Christmas&nbsp;and currently stars in the series In Gayle We Trust.</p><h2 id=dan-hedaya---5-million>Dan Hedaya - $5 Million</h2><p>Dan Hedaya is from Brooklyn, New York and is a working actor that you will surely recognize from&nbsp;many films and series because he has appeared in nearly everything. He is well versed in playing a somewhat sleazy ex-husband, mainly for his roles as Morty in The First Wives Club&nbsp;or Carla Tortelli's ex-husband on Cheers.</p><p>Hedaya also portrayed the&nbsp;overprotective father to our girl Cher in Clueless. Dan Hedaya is an expert supporting actor and has been working in TV and movies for over forty years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-sisto---6-million>Jeremy Sisto - $6 Million</h2><p>Remembered for portraying the handsome, rich, and overconfident&nbsp;Elton, Jeremy Sisto was born in Grass Valley, California and graduated from UCLA before starting his long career in film and television.</p><p>In the movie, Cher tries to set Elton up with the less popular Tai to give her status a boost, but unfortunately, he is just too into Cher. After Clueless, Sisto went on to work in both TV and movies and had a recurring role on Six Feet Under, as well as Law & Order and FBI.</p><h2 id=breckin-meyer---8-million>Breckin Meyer - $8 Million</h2><p>Breckin Meyer is from Minneapolis, Minnesota and often plays laid back surfer dudes or skater boys. His role as Travis in Clueless&nbsp;serves as a prime example. Travis was a goofy class clown type in their Beverly Hills school who liked Tai. Even though Tai is discouraged from dating him, due to his apparent lack of popularity, in the end, Travis wins out!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest Paid Figure Skaters In The World</a></span></p><p>Meyer has been in many movies and TV series and also does voice acting. He's been in Robot Chicken, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, and King of The Hill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wallace-shawn---8-million>Wallace Shawn - $8 Million</h2><p>Wallace Shawn was born in New York City and had a stint as a scholar before turning playwright and actor. Although he got his start writing and acting in plays, you're likely to know Shawn as a character actor for his many bumbling supporting roles.</p><p>In Clueless,&nbsp;Shawn plays the hard to please teacher, Mr. Hall.&nbsp;However, you probably recognize him from the iconic Princess Bride&nbsp;and the&nbsp;new hit series Young Sheldon. Or the many animated series he's lent his voice to, including&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;and the Toy Story franchise.</p><h2 id=brittany-murphy---10-million>Brittany Murphy - $10 Million</h2><p>Brittany Murphy began acting at a young age, earning a few recurring parts on Blossom and Sister Sister, the actress's role as Clueless's&nbsp;cute and naive Tai was what skyrocketed her into the public eye. Murphy then went on to star in many romantic comedies like Just Married&nbsp;and&nbsp;Little Black Book.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Kid Actors Ever</a></span></p><p>She also took some grittier roles like Girl Interrupted&nbsp;alongside Winona Ryder and Freeway. Sadly,&nbsp;Murphy passed away&nbsp;under somewhat mysterious circumstances in 2009. At the time of her death, Murphy's net worth was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=donald-faison---12-million>Donald Faison - $12 Million</h2><p>Donald Faison is an alum of the Professional Children's School in Manhattan, where the Culkin brothers and Sarah Michelle Gellar also attended. He had a few small parts as a child in TV commercials before landing the role of Dionne's on-again-off-again boyfriend, Murray, in&nbsp;Clueless.</p><p>Faison was also in the TV spinoff of Clueless and then went on to play Dr. Christohper Turk in the long-running series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scrubs</a>, as well as doing voice acting for Robot Chicken. He is still working on screen and is currently on the sci-fi TV series Emergence.</p><h2 id=alicia-silverstone---20-million>Alicia Silverstone - $20 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Alicia Silverstone</a> played the dream girl on The Wonder Years, an obsessed teenager in The Crush, and was featured in several of Aerosmith's music videos before she landed&nbsp;the lead role of the popularity-obsessed, unlucky-in-love Cher in Clueless.</p><p>After she wowed a whole generation with her valley girl slang, plaid mini skirts, chunky cellphone, and rad convertible, Silverstone went on to star in several more teen thrillers before playing Batgirl in Batman & Robin. She even lent her voice to the lead role in the cartoon&nbsp;Braceface.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-rudd---70-million>Paul Rudd - $70 Million</h2><p>You remember Paul Rudd as the cute and grounded Josh, Cher's stepbrother turned lover that made us all cringe slightly as we wondered if it was weird or okay that they got together in the end.</p><p>Rudd has had a long career in theater and film and was born to British parents in New Jersey. Rudd has earned many iconic parts over the years, including the ultra-cool womanizer Andy in Wet Hot American Summer, Ned in Our Idiot Brother, and most recently he portrayed&nbsp;Ant-Man and joined the <a href=#>MCU</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Living With Yourself: 5 Reasons It's Paul Rudd's Best Role (& 5 It's Not)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8KlrJ6klajAbrnOr6CeZZOWwLV50ZqlpJ2UYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-siblings-behind-the-james-bond-franchise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Siblings Behind The James Bond Franchise">&larr;
