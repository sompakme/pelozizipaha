And this also meant that the cast members got the chance to act together again, which must have felt like a dream come true. It's sweet when actors talk about the strong connection that they formed with their co-stars while filming the same show for years. The Full House cast seems to have experienced that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, <a href=#>Candace Cameron Bure's relationship with Mary-Kate Olsen</a> doesn't seem to be a positive one. And in recent years, Candace Cameron Bure and Jodie Sweetin haven't gotten along, either. What really went down between Bure and Sweetin? Did they have a huge argument? And were they ever good friends?</p><h2 id=did-full-house-stars-candace-cameron-bure-and-jodie-sweetin-fight>Did Full House Stars Candace Cameron Bure And Jodie Sweetin Fight?</h2><p><a href=#>Andrea Barber didn't want to act after Full House</a>, and Jodie Sweetin hasn't taken on a lot of roles, either. Sweetin took a break after the popular sitcom. And, like Candace Cameron Bure, the actress has found a newfound career in Christmas movies. In the 2010s and 2020s, Sweetin starred in Lifetime and Hallmark holiday films like Merry & Bright, Merry Swissmas, and Finding Santa.</p><p>While Sweetin and Bure have a history together and a lot in common, they had some drama in the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fuller-house-jodie-sweetin-candace-cameron-bure.jpg><p>In November 2022, Us Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bure stopped following Sweetin on Instagram</a>. When Bure switched from Lifetime to the Great American Family Network, she said, "I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.” JoJo Siwa posted on her Instagram and said these words were upsetting, and Sweetin wrote, "You know I love you."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jodie Sweetin Understood Why The Olsen Twins Did Not Return For Fuller House, And Her Reasoning Makes A Lot Of Sense</a></span></p><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, a source explained that the Full House actresses "have different views and opinions on various important topics."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=were-candace-cameron-bure-and-jodie-sweetin-friends-while-filming-full-house>Were Candace Cameron Bure And Jodie Sweetin Friends While Filming Full House?</h2><p>Fans hope that with a cozy, warm, and charming sitcom like Full House, the cast members would have loved filming with each other. And that does seem to be the case. Stars like John Stamos, Lori Loughlin, and the late Bob Saget often talked about the great relationships that the actors have always had with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure-smiling.jpg><p>It sounds like Candace Cameron Bure and Jodie Sweetin got along on the set of Full House.

The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Full House stars talked about their relationship</a> and how they have always been tight-knit friends. And it sounds as if Bure and Sweetin always had an amazing friendship. They said that it was really nice to be able to work with each other again on Fuller House because they are so familiar with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fuller-house-andrea-barber-jodie-sweetin-and-candace-cameron-bure.jpg><p>Bure said of her co-stars, "when you are genuinely close friends or as close as sisters, you’ve got each other’s backs."</p><p>Sweetin told People, "It’s been lifelong friends. I would say the only people I’ve known longer than my Full House family are my parents and my actual family, and then this family we’ve all seen each other grow up and go through everything in life, so to be able to bring that back onscreen is awesome."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bure also said that she considers Sweetin and Barber to be family, not just pals. She said, "We are so comfortable with one another and we really are sisters. It’s beyond friends, we are as close as sisters could be, it’s amazing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Candace Cameron Bure Really Feels About Being Replaced On The Aurora Teagarden Franchise And If It Cost Her A Fortune</a></span></p><p>Since the actresses were just kids themselves when they filmed Full House, it's no wonder that they became friends.

And they have seen each other go through a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candace-cameron-bure-and-jodie-sweetin-s-friendship-soured-but-did-the-full-house-stars-ever-get-along_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bure married Valeri Bure in 1996 and they have three children named Lev, Maksim, and Natasha.</p><p>Sweetin is on her fourth marriage and has two daughters, Beatrix and Zoie. When experiencing so many life changes, it can be especially nice to lean on an old friend who has been there for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jodie-sweetin.jpg><p>Middle child Stephanie Tanner and oldest daughter DJ Tanner might not have always gotten along. They bugged each other as they fought for their dad Danny's attention and experienced the tough parts of growing up.

And while neither has said that they are best friends again, it seems that they have at least been civil to each other recently.</p><p>In February 2023, Us Weekly reported that the Full House stars were going to see each other at '90s Con in March.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jodie-sweetin-andrea-barber-candace-cameron-bure.jpg><p>It's possible that Sweetin and Bure will never forget the bond that they have always had, but it will take some time to get over the rough patch that they went through in 2022. But as of this writing, there is no evidence that the two hang out all the time or are as close as they once were. Sweetin posts on her Instagram almost daily and didn't post any pictures with Bure in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Full House fans definitely hope that Candace Cameron Bure and Jodie Sweetin's friendship isn't over forever. While it's possible that they aren't close anymore, it's also likely that they have decided to move on from their disagreement and don't want to speak about it publicly. Fans will have to wait and observe whether the actors address their friendship or continue to be silent about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmK6vsMCcnGabkaKys7vNZpmuqpVirq%2BwjKOmnaGVYsC4scStoKerXZu%2FqrHNnaqhoaBisq%2BwxJ1knaGUYsGpsYyfrKWkXZ28tr%2FEZqqtmaKoeqbCxKtkoJ2kYq6tu82gZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlene-tilton-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlene Tilton Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
