It sound like you trying to do what I do, ni**a. Send me some different sh*t.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 38-year-old producer was taken aback by the request and chose to not send Puff anything else. “I was like, ‘F**k it,'” he said. “Next thing I know, the ni**a deciphered my records and reached out to everybody I collaborated with and dissected me from the situation. So he called&nbsp;Cardiak&nbsp;to his house like, ‘You need to be one of The Hitmen.’ Next thing,&nbsp;Eric Bellinger&nbsp;is in the Bahamas with motherf**kin’ Puff and they’re singing songs together.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hitmaka didn’t stop there. He claimed that Diddy helped <a href=#>French Montana</a> with his 2021 album They Got Amnesia and took his producer tag off of the opening record. “I was like, ‘Damn, this ni**a is really diabolical,'” he recalled. “So I wasn’t f**king with him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to Hitmaka, his issues with the “I Need A Girl” artist go back to the 2000s when he went by the name Yung Berg and collaborated with producer Rob Holladay. Puff allegedly called him over to his Daddy’s House studio and asked who was producing his tracks. The multi-platinum producer revealed he worked with Holladay, whom he had signed at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Next thing I know, he signed Rob Holladay,” Hitmaka said. “Put that ni**a on jets and turned the ni**a against me, had him stop working with me and all type of sh*t. So this is a recurring type of thing.” Most recently, Diddy called Hitmaka on the phone to discuss his production efforts on <a href=#>Tink’s</a> 2023 LP Thanks 4 Nothing, which went No. 1, and how his artist <a href=#>Jozzy</a> would overtake her spot.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He was like, ‘Ni**a, you in good company. Jozzy No. 2, Tink No. 1,'” Hitmaka recalled. “I’m like, ‘Ni**a,&nbsp;you&nbsp;in good company. I’m No. 1. The f**k you talking about?’ He like, ‘Ni**a, you know the type of money I’ve spent — you ain’t gonna be in that spot for long!’ And sh*t, I stayed in that spot and she didn’t.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The last year of Diddy’s career has been full of allegations and accusations, both business-wise and interpersonally. Former signees have spoken about his shady business dealings and, in November 2023, his ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Cassie filed a lawsuit </a>detailing the rape, sexual assault, and more mistreatment she endured while they were dating.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Though they <a href=#>settled outside of court </a>for an undisclosed amount, the lawsuit created a snowball effect as more people came forward with stories about the mogul. One woman claims that he and former Bad Boy president <a href=#>Harve Pierre</a> raped her when she was <a href=#>17 years old</a>. Producer <a href=#>Lil Rod</a> filed a lawsuit claiming sexual assault, drugging, being threatened, and being forced to engage with sex workers. <a href=#>Yung Miami’s</a> cousin was also implicated in the lawsuit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX522tbnApJhmnJmZsbp5wK2rnqWgqcBuvsSpo6KbkamybrnUrKCcZZmjwaa%2BxZ6pnmWTpLmtrcGoqZqsn6fAbn2RbGtxbWVphXJ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-island-boys-offered-spot-on-boxing-reality-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Island Boys Offered Spot On Boxing Reality Show">&larr;
