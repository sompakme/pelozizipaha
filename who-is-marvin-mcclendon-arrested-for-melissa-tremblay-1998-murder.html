Find out more about this case.</strong></p><p>The Essex Attorney’s Office issued a statement on the matter, McClendon, now 74, was apprehended in Alabama on April 26, 2022.</p><p>Prosecutors have charged Marvin McClendon, better known as “Skip” McClendon, for murdering Melissa Ann Tremblay of Salem, New Hampshire, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on September 12, 1988. In the old Boston & Maine Railway Yard, her body was discovered “between Andover Street and South Broadway in Lawrence, in the old Boston & Maine Railway Yard.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-marvin-mcclendon></span>Who Is Marvin McClendon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marvin McClendon, a 74-year-old Alabama man, was arrested in Lawrence in 1988 for the murder of 11-year-old Melissa Tremblay.</p><p>He is a retired employee of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, although he isn’t sure if he worked for the state in 1988. McClendon was residing in Chelmsford and had several connections to Lawrence. He worked in the city and frequented various venues, including the Salem Street Seventh-Day Adventist Church.</p><p>According to Essex District Attorney, McClendon may or may not have known Melissa or her family. He said that investigators have no reason to believe the suspect was engaged in any other crimes.</p><p>According to Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, he was caught in Alabama Tuesday night and charged as a fugitive of justice, who spoke at a news conference Wednesday morning.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facebook-photo-marvin-mcclendon-arrested-for-melissa-tremblay-1998-murder></span>Facebook Photo: Marvin McClendon Arrested For Melissa Tremblay 1998 Murder<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marvin McClendon was arrested in Lawrence about 35 years ago in connection with the death of 11-year-old Melissa Tremblay.</p><p>Tremblay was a New Hampshire native who lived in Salem, was slain while visiting a social club in Lawrence with her mother and mother’s boyfriend. She left the bar to perform in the surrounding neighborhoods, and on September 12, 1988, she was found stabbed to death in a freight yard off Andover Street. For more than 33 years, the case has remained unresolved.</p><p>Blodgett said evidence on the girl’s body led investigators to McClendon, but he wouldn’t go into detail, saying additional details would be revealed at the arraignment. McClendon has been a person of interest in the case “for some time,” according to the D.A.</p><p>He was accused of being a wanted criminal and is scheduled to appear in court in Alabama on Thursday. If he refuses rendition, he will be extradited to Massachusetts and charged with murder.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-marvin-mcclendon-family></span>Who Are Marvin McClendon Family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to public records, Marvin McClendon and his wife live in Bremen, Alabama. His parents and children and the rest of his family are not mentioned in the media.</p><p>Other data regarding his life, such as when he retired from the Massachusetts Department of Corrections and how long he lived in Alabama, were unavailable right away. The district attorney said he couldn’t say whether McClendon knew the victim or his family at this time.</p><p>Blodgett stated, “We’re not going to stop; we’ll follow every single lead.”&nbsp;&nbsp;He stated that his staff is devoted to bringing justice to the people, no matter how long it takes.</p><p>Whether it takes 30 years or 60 years, we will do everything we can to bring some solace and justice to the families who have lost loved ones to murder.”</p><p>Essex District Attorney claimed he didn’t know much about McClendon’s life in Alabama. He claims to have worked in Bremen in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ymmKuumaN6rq%2FCpZynnJ%2BjeqK%2B0Z6qrZ2UYrOwvoymnKWho6iubsDRnqSbpJGuenKFmHFkpq2imbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-sza-dating-sza-boyfriend-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is SZA dating?
