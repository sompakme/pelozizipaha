The series covered <a href=#>many different storylines</a>, including that sex tape, Caitlin's transition, weddings, divorces, births, and, of course, plastic surgery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashians have never fully shied away from the fact they have had plastic surgery and there were even a few times during the KUWTK run that they allowed the cameras into the operating room. However, the oldest sister, <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong>, supposedly has this one serious regret when it comes to her own plastic surgery.</p><h2 id=what-plastic-surgery-has-kourtney-kardashian-had>What Plastic Surgery Has Kourtney Kardashian Had?</h2><p>While her sisters, particularly Kim and Kylie, and her mom, Kris, have been somewhat open about the fact that they have had plastic surgery, Kourtney has been a bit more guarded about any work (if any) that she has had done.</p><p>However, while the <a href=#>rumors are always rife about the latest surgery</a> her sisters and mom have had done, Kourtney is often overlooked; which probably comes as no surprise given she has her own healthy lifestyle company, Poosh, and it would seem like something that wouldn't fit in with her brand and lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the website even <a href=#>recommended a natural 'at-home facelift'</a> that people can use instead of having to make an expensive trip down to the doctor's office, which more or less suggests that Kourtney herself wouldn't be interested in having the surgery done. Or would she?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian Says She's Only "Skinny" When She's Unhappy</a></span></p><p>As far as it is publicly known, the only plastic surgery that Kourtney has is breast implants. She did these when she was 21 years old and doesn't seem to have had anything done since.</p><p>However, in 2021, an Instagram account (that has since been deleted) posted some before and after photos of the Kardashian sisters and made some shocking claims of work that Kourtney had supposedly done, even though the reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly denied the rumors</a> and has never confirmed anything herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kourtney-kardashian.jpg><p>Plus, given that in a 2010 interview with Nightline, she spoke about her breast implants and said that she doesn't care about whether they're a secret or not, it is more than likely that she is telling the truth about the other rumored surgeries she has had.</p><h2 id=does-kourtney-kardashian-regret-getting-breast-implants>Does Kourtney Kardashian Regret Getting Breast Implants?</h2><p>As she had her breast implants at 21 and that's quite a young age, it's very easy to do stuff in your younger years that later on in life you will live to regret.</p><p>Kourtney seems to have realized this regarding her breast implants and has even said that if she could go back in time, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wouldn't have them done</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her feelings about her breast implants were revealed in a 2011 interview with Showbiz Spy, where she said that having plastic surgery done on her breasts made them look a certain way that wasn't unique or natural to her, and she didn't like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kourtney-kardashian-1.jpg><p>She made the same comment a few years later during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine</a>, where she stated that she liked what her breasts looked like prior to having surgery and that nowadays, she's not really into having cosmetic procedures done, unlike <a href=#>most of her famous family</a>.</p><p>Kourtney went on to say that the reason why she doesn't like having surgical procedures done is that she prefers to embrace her imperfections whilst also wanting to look her best â€” something that she does rather well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is able to look her best by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which includes eating healthy food and getting plenty of exercise.</p><p>This also includes a rather lengthy, but essential, <a href=#>skincare routine</a> that helps to keep her looking young and fresh-faced and relieves her of feeling any need to get any more surgery that she may go on to regret.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The Strict Rules Kourtney Kardashian Follows For Her Health</a></span></p><p>Plus, given that she has previously <a href=#>spoken out against the chemicals that can be found in many makeup products</a>, she's unlikely to want to have any more plastic surgery as many of the products used will contain chemicals that can be quite harmful to the body.</p><h2 id=did-kourtney-kardashian-remove-her-breast-implants>Did Kourtney Kardashian Remove Her Breast Implants?</h2><p>It was during that 2011 interview with Showbiz Spy that Kourtney mentioned that she was considering having her breast implants removed. But over ten years since that interview happened, has she actually gone ahead and had them taken out?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time she said she was waiting for her son Mason, who was only a one-year-old at the time, to finish breastfeeding, and only once that had happened would she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">properly start thinking about whether to remove them</a> or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Some Fans Aren't Happy With Kourtney Kardashian's New Supplement Line</a></span></p><p>Yet no updates occurred, and Kourtney went on to have two more children that she also nursed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kourtney-kardashian-2.jpg><p>It's currently unknown whether Kourtney has had her breast implants removed or not and if she has, she hasn't spoken about it publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it is recommended that breast implants are either removed or replaced every 10â€“15 years, and given that it's been 20 years since Kourtney had her implants put in, if she hasn't already had them removed, she may want to start considering it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLy2vtOnnLJlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2drrexjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6qqWK2rrzLmqWtq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-klay-thompson-dating-klay-thompson-girlfriend-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Klay Thompson dating?
