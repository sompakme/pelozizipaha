Love Island is a <a href=#>reality show</a> based on the theme of love and coupling. However, all the <a href=#>couples formed</a> as part of this show are not necessarily romantic partners. Since it is mandatory to form a pair with another contestant on the show, the couples are either based on romantic compatibility or survival.</p><p>The contestants must live in a villa called an Island, in the sense that they have to remain isolated from the rest of the world as long as they are on the show. Participants may either get eliminated if they fail to form a couple with another contender or if the viewers vote them out. The audience can vote someone out by voting against them through the Love Island app.</p><p>It might sound complicated, but this reality show has been quite popular throughout the UK, where it originated, before being imported by the US and Australia. This reality show has had such good reach that some of its contestants have emerged as millionaires after production ended. The grand prize for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winning couple is $100,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following is a list of Love Island Stars that made millions after the show.</p><h2 id=the-couple-alex-bowman-and-olivia-buckland>The Couple Alex Bowman and Olivia Buckland</h2><p>Alex Bowman and Olivia Buckland are perhaps two of the most <a href=#>popular contestants</a> to appear on the reality show. They met on the show in 2016 and proved to their audience that it is possible to find love on a reality show. The couple tied the knot two years later.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Hollywood Power Couples (& Their Net Worth)</a></span></p><p>After making about $6 million through Love Island's fame, the couple set out to live a life together and make some more bucks.

She has also launched her brand of make-up products. Currently, her net worth is about $2.36 million.</p><h2 id=amber-davies-and-kem-cetinay>Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay</h2><p>Another famous couple that won the hearts of the audience on the sets of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Island</a> and took away the grand prize was Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay.

He is known for a television role with Olivia Atwood. Later they split, and then he made another show with his best friend, Kem Cetinay (and fellow name on the list).</p><p>Hughes has also <a href=#>endorsed brands and MNCs like McDonald's</a> and Carphone Warehouse to make his millions. Currently, he is worth about $1.94 million.</p><h2 id=olivia-atwood>Olivia Atwood</h2><p>Olivia Atwood was Hughes's romantic partner on the show and for a short while outside the show. She, too, belongs to the list of Love Island stars who made millions after the show, grossing about $1.67 million after the show.</p><p>She, like her ex-boyfriend, has earned millions through her appearances on panel shows like 'Celebs Go Dating' and the performance with Hughes. Her career as a <a href=#>social media influencer</a> has also made her a considerable sum of money.</p><h2 id=molly-mae-hugh-and-tom-fury>Molly Mae Hugh and Tom Fury</h2><p>Another star couple emerging from the Love Island reality show is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly Mae Hugh</a> and Tom Fury.

Collectively they have amassed a fortune of about $2.78 million.</p><p>A few other stars from the Love Island reality show have made millions after the show too. That would include Amber Gill with her $2.78 million, Kady McDermott with $1.81 million, and Gabby Allen, who has a net worth of about $1.81 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Richest Celebrities Who Are Generous 'Sugar Mamas'</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heat World</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital FM</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sMLEZqCspJGjsW6%2F05qprGWdlrGmecyio6Whn6PAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./andrew-flintoff-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew Flintoff Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
