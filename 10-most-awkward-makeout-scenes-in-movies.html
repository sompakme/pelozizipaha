Any genre of movie will have some sort of make out scene thrown into it for our viewing pleasure. MTV gives out an award for the best kiss every year, actors fall in love with each other in real life because of the scripted romance, and a good kissing scene can even make a movie a blockbuster hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But not every kiss is as romantic as <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> and <a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a>’ rain-soaked lip lock in The Notebook. In fact, many stars have had their awkward on-screen kisses caught on tape for us to watch over and over again. Whether these moments were purposely uncomfortable for comedic relief, actors just don’t have that chemistry with one another, or maybe the storyline behind the kiss is what makes it awkward, there are plenty of clumsy and embarrassing kissing scenes in films throughout the years for us to laugh at. Not that we’re saying these actors are bad make-out partners in real life, but some stars even made this list twice! Here are 10 of the most awkward kissing scenes in movies.</p><h2 id=10-the-twilight-saga-eclipse-kristen-stewart-amp-taylor-lautner><strong>10. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse – Kristen Stewart & Taylor Lautner</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>, the star of the popular Twilight films, has been called out on her awkward demeanor numerous times. Unfortunately this personality trait comes through in her acting as well, especially her kissing scenes with co-stars. Not only is the Bella and Edward (<a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>) romance difficult to watch sometimes, but the lack of on-screen chemistry between Stewart and <a href=#>Taylor Lautner</a> (aka Bella and Jacob) is as obvious as it is painful. Their kiss in the 2010 film The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was extremely uncomfortable. Stewart has said; “Our intimate moments are so few and far between – and weird.”</p><p></p><h2 id=9-wet-hot-american-summer-paul-rudd-amp-elizabeth-banks><strong>9. Wet Hot American Summer – Paul Rudd & Elizabeth Banks</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best parts of the 2001 comedy Wet Hot American Summer is the kissing scene between Andy and Lindsey (<a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> and <a href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a>) when Rudd said; “You taste like a burger. I don’t like you anymore.” It’s hilariously awkward, and Banks agrees it was a weird thing to film; “We both went into it knowing that we were just going to do the most disgusting kissing we could imagine. There was nothing romantic about it at all at that point. It was a lot of licking. I was trying to make as many obnoxiously loud noises with my tongue as possible.”</p><p></p><h2 id=8-wayne-s-world-2-kim-bassinger-amp-dana-carvey><strong>8. Wayne’s World 2 – Kim Bassinger & Dana Carvey</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The awkwardness of the kissing scene in Wayne’s World 2, between <a href=#>Kim Bassinger</a> and <a href=#>Dana Carvey</a>, stems from the fact that Bassinger is one of the most beautiful women in the world and Carvey’s character, Garth, is the epitome of a nerd. In the moment of the kiss, Garth can’t seem to close his mouth or his eyes. Meanwhile Bassinger’s character, Honey Hornee, knows exactly what she’s doing. It is most definitely one of the funniest kisses in film history. The two were actually nominated for Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards in 1994.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-everyone-says-i-love-you-woody-allen-amp-julia-roberts><strong>7. Everyone Says I Love You – Woody Allen & Julia Roberts</strong></h2><p>Via screeninsults.com</p><p><a href=#>Woody Allen</a> and <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> are two very talents individuals, you would think they would be able to partake in a romantic on-screen kiss. Unfortunately the actors couldn’t pull off the chemistry necessary to convince audiences of their affection for one another in the film Everyone Says I Love You. The movie from 1996 didn’t do as well as Allen’s other films at the box office and that awkward kiss is no doubt a big reason why. Critics, on the other hand, gave the movie rave reviews. It was nominated for Best Motion Picture in the Comedy/Musical category at the 1997 Golden Globe Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-back-to-the-future-michael-j-fox-amp-lea-thompson><strong>6. Back to the Future – Michael J. Fox & Lea Thompson</strong></h2><p>There are many great moments in the 1985 film Back to the Future. Marty McFly kissing his mother when he goes back in time is definitely not one of those great moments. Granted Lorraine doesn’t know Marty is her son, but that doesn’t make it any less weird. The uncomfortable moment when she jumps on Marty in the car and kisses him will always be considered one of the most awkward kissing scenes in movie history. Regardless, Back to the Future won an Academy Award, and was nominated for three others.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-just-friends-ryan-reynolds-amp-anna-faris><strong>5. Just Friends – Ryan Reynolds & Anna Faris</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Anna Faris</a>’ character in Just Friends, the psychotic pop star Samantha James, is the highlight of the 2005 comedy. Much like everything else about her, the lip-biting disasters that are her kissing scenes with <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a>’ character are hilariously uncomfortable. In one scene, Faris is kissing Reynolds with a mouth full of toothpaste, something they actually enjoyed filming; “I don’t think he knew what was coming, and I just really get him. I mean, that toothpaste was all over the place.” Faris said of the improvised scene.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-i-love-you-man-paul-rudd-amp-thomas-lennon><strong>4. I Love You Man – Paul Rudd & Thomas Lennon</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course we have to mention the hilarious kiss featured in the 2009 comedy I Love You Man. <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a>’s character is on the search for a male friend, but after hanging out with Thomas Lennon’s character, Rudd gets blindsided when Lennon kisses him on the lips. The look on Rudd’s face is priceless, and Lennon’s later line “You’re a whore Peter” is one of the most quotable moments in modern cinema. Lennon has stated about the moment; “Kissing Paul Rudd is always a good time. I highly recommend it. If you see him walking down the street, just jump in. He’s cool. He won’t mind.”</p><p></p><h2 id=3-the-40-year-old-virgin-elizabeth-banks-amp-steve-carell><strong>3. The 40-Year-Old Virgin – Elizabeth Banks & Steve Carell</strong></h2><p>Via telegraph.co.uk</p><p>2005’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin is an awkward movie in general, as a middle-aged man, played by <a href=#>Steve Carell</a> sets out to lose his virginity. There are many uncomfortable moments, but his sexual escapade with <a href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a> takes the cake. Carrell’s wife, on the other hand, wasn’t so amused; “She had taken care of our one and our four-year-old, and I came in and sat down on the couch and kicked my shoes off and said ‘I am so tired!’. She shot me a look that I’ll never forget. ‘Oh really? You’ve just made out with Elizabeth Banks all day, when I’ve been caring for your children. Don’t even talk to me about it!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-dumb-and-dumber-jim-carrey-amp-lauren-holly><strong>2. Dumb and Dumber – Jim Carrey & Lauren Holly</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jim Carrey</a> and Lauren Holly won the <a href=#>MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss</a> in 1995 for the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber, not because it was romantic or sexual, but because of how funny it is. In the dream sequence where the kiss takes place, it looks like Carrey is eating Holly’s face instead of kissing it. The pair actually fell in love on set and were married from 1996-1997. If you watch their acceptance speech for their Best Kiss award, you can see how smitten they were with each other. Hopefully Carrey was a better kisser in real life.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back-mark-hamill-amp-carrie-fisher><strong>1. Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back– Mark Hamill & Carrie Fisher</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 1980 Star Wars film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, before Luke and Leia find out that they’re siblings - twins no less - they share a pretty intimate and romantic kiss. It’s <a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a>’s character Leia that actually kisses <a href=#>Mark Hamill</a>’s Luke, but the reasoning behind it is unclear. Some say it’s because Luke came close to death, while others say Leia was trying to make <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a>’s character Han Solo jealous. Either way, it’s weird in the moment and even more awkward when audiences finally find out that the two are related.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>ew.com</a>, <a href=#>sheknows.com</a>, <a href=#>yahoo.com</a>, <a href=#>mtv.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ivLTAjJqupK%2BRp7FuucCknKitpGLApLHNnqpmoZ5iurDCyJ6qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brownsville-blogger-top-brownsville-ger-blogs-and-websites.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brownsville Blogger  Top Brownsville Ger Blogs and Websites">&larr;
