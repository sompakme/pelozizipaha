The Smith parents decided to raise their children to be independent and unrestrained—a parenting style Will Smith has jokingly&nbsp;questioned whether it&nbsp;may have been a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mistake</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Member Of The Smith's Family Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Jaden and Willow Smith are entitled and rich; making some of the things on this list not as surprising as you would think. Keep reading for ten of the most expensive and crazy things that the Smiths have bought for their children. Now, in all fairness, the Smith children may have bought some of these items with their own hard-earned money; nevertheless, Will and Jaden's success arguably put them in a position to do so.</p><h2 id=jaden-s-supreme-x-louis-vuitton-crossbody-bag---2-500>Jaden’s Supreme X Louis Vuitton Crossbody Bag - $2,500</h2><p>While it may not be the most expensive item on this list, Jaden’s red Louis Vuitton Crossbody bag from the Supreme X collection is definitely an outrageously priced item. Sitting at about $2,500, the bag can be seen wrapped around Jaden’s body in public casually and on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it’s paired with a hoodie and pants or a Jack and Jones suit, Jayden seems to love to show off his expensive LV accessories, as he’s been seen leaving LV stores with more bags than one can count.</p><h2 id=willow-s-porsche-cayenne-turbo---120-000>Willow’s Porsche Cayenne Turbo - $120,000</h2><p>The first of a few cars to show up on this list, the Porsche Cayenne Turbo is a luxury vehicle with a top speed of almost 290 miles per hour and can go 0 to 60 in a little over 4 seconds. Knowing that she was only 17 years old at the time, it is a little scary that she has all of that power at her fingertips.</p><p>However, it does have a high safety rating, coming in at a 95% for the average strapped-in adult (driver and passenger).</p><h2 id=jaden-s-tesla-model-x-between-100-000-amp-130-000>Jaden’s Tesla Model X – Between $100,000&nbsp;& $130,000</h2><p>Clothes and accessories don’t seem to be Jaden’s only weakness. During Coachella, April 2019, the crowd was stunned as the 20-year-old performed on top of a Tesla Model X, a car that was identical to his own (minus the color).</p><p>One of the safest hybrid cars in the world, Jaden can be seen cruising around in the luxury vehicle at just 17 years old. Sure, dad might just be looking out for him, but really? Then again, with a net worth of <a href=#>$8 million</a>, Jaden could buy another for fun!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willow-s-toyota-mirai---50-000>Willow’s Toyota Mirai - $50,000</h2><p>You guessed it; another car. Just because a luxurious German car wasn’t enough, Willow also owns a Toyota Mirai, which isn’t exactly cheap, either. This hydrogen cell vehicle is a reliable car with a sleek and stylish look. Now 18-year-old Willow Smith owns $170,000 worth in cars. That’s incredible!</p><p>A common theme in the cars that Will Smith’s children drive is definitely the safety rating; the Toyota Mirai electric car has a five-star safety rating with enhanced barriers designed to handle T-bone crashes more effectively.</p><h2 id=jaden-s-louis-vuitton-shoes-just-over-1-000>Jaden’s Louis Vuitton Shoes – Just over $1,000</h2><p>While it is definitely not the most expensive item on this list, Jaden’s love for Louis Vuitton and fashion is very evident as he struts his stuff in these women’s shoes. He says he loves them, and it doesn’t bother him that they are women’s shoes. Why should it?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Member Of The Smith's Family Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Jaden’s fashion sense has been described in the past as “non-gender binary” which is a very important topic these days. He seems to live by the rule that when it comes to fashion and your artistic style, there are no rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willow-s-house-42-million>“Willow’s” House – $42 Million</h2><p>To be clear, Willow is currently living in one of her father’s homes, which is estimated to be valued at approximately $42 million.&nbsp;Whether the house was handed over as a gift&nbsp;remains unknown, but she lives in it by herself for the most part.</p><p>While her parents, both very famous celebrities, are working all around the world; Willow enjoys a massive, empty home all for herself. This is not to say that she is always alone, as there are many interviews and photos that show the family reunites quite often.</p><h2 id=jaden-s-gold-encrusted-grill-50-000>Jaden’s Gold Encrusted Grill – $50,000</h2><p>In early 2019, Jaden appeared at a party with a gold grill. That’s right; gold teeth! Gold grills can go for as little as $250 to as expensive as $30,000, depending on how much you add to them.</p><p>Jaden’s grill, as pictured, was a thick band of gold, encrusted with what looks like little diamonds. The last time a grill like this was priced out, it clocked in&nbsp;at&nbsp;$30,000 and made with 160 diamond. Jaden’s masterpiece blew that one&nbsp;out of the water at $<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50,000</a>.</p><h2 id=willow-s-designer-chanel-between-1-000-amp-3-500>Willow’s Designer Chanel – Between $1,000&nbsp;& $3,500</h2><p>While Jaden has his Louis Vuitton and their designer clothes and accessories, Willow has her Channel and their designer clothes and accessories. Of course, Chanel (in comparison to Louis Vuitton) is the less expensive choice, for the most part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Willow Smith made an appearance at Chanel’s fall/winter show in a Chanel full body suit and accessories. According to the Chanel website, jumpsuits like this are sold for about $3,500 while accessories like earrings and necklaces&nbsp;cost somewhere between&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;and $1,200.</p><h2 id=jaden-s-million-dollar-mansion---8-million>Jaden’s Million Dollar Mansion - $8 Million</h2><p>When Jaden Smith was just 14 years old, he told his parents that he wanted to be emancipated as a 15th&nbsp;birthday present, explaining that he just wanted to move out on his own. After talking to his mother and father about the subject, he decided to stay, saying that everything he needed was in his parent’s house. In 2017, at 18 years old, Jaden moved out on his own; in an $8 million mansion with a number of his buddies.</p><h2 id=willow-s-role-in-i-am-legend-4-million>Willow’s Role In I Am Legend– $4 Million</h2><p>Willows net worth was determined to be about $4 million and it’s mostly due to her musical and acting talents. However, without her father including her in the movie I Am Legend&nbsp;in 2007, Willow would not have been exposed to the acting world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her breakthrough&nbsp;role&nbsp;was the daughter of the main character of I Am Legend&nbsp;(played by her real father, Will Smith). Willow has made the statement in the past that she sometimes wished that she was never brought into the business.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Will Smith Addresses Jada Pinkett Smith Divorce Rumors</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5no6K2tbSMn5imoZyueqS%2BwLOwZpqfqrSpwIyfpqtlk522rbDRnqVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-victoria-beckham-and-mel-b-still-feuding-decades-after-the-spice-girls-disbanded.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Victoria Beckham And Mel B Still Feuding Decades After The Spice Girls Disbanded?">&larr;
