Sarah Silverman's <a href=#><strong>Seinfeld</strong></a> role was one of her first big breaks, along with her time on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a>. Following her career has always been fascinating because she balances her original comedy with movie and TV parts, and no one can really guess what she's going to do next.</p><p><strong>Sarah Silverman's Wreck-It Ralph character Vanellope von Schweetz </strong>also got people's attention as she's a charming and integral part of the film. Vanellope is pals with John C. Reilly's main character and couldn't be more adorable. However, even though she cared deeply about playing this fan-favorite character, Silverman's net worth is lower than fans might think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-sarah-silverman-39-s-net-worth>What Is Sarah Silverman's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Silverman has a net worth of $8 million</a>.

According to Box Office Mojo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wreck-It Ralph grossed $49,038,712 in its opening weekend</a>. The movie had a budget of $165 million and grossed even more than that by the time it ended its run in theaters, which is incredibly impressive.

It's a shame that she didn't enjoy her time on the sitcom as her character had such a notable storyline. Emily can't stop moving her legs at night because she has a health issue called "Jimmy legs," which forces Kramer to find alternative sleeping arrangements. The joke at the end of the episode is that George's mom Estelle Costanza (played by Harris) has "Jimmy arms."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sarah-silverman-stood-up-to-michael-richards-during-her-tense-experience-on-seinfeld.jpg><p>Seinfeld fans might assume that starring in an episode of the popular sitcom would result in a huge payday. That might not have been the case, though. While Silverman hasn't spoken about her Seinfeld salary, one <a href=#>Seinfeld guest star was only paid a few thousand dollars</a> for their episode.

This was a notable role since it was so different from the comedic characters she is known for playing. It makes sense that people would feel that way since she is known for quirky sitcom parts like Emily in Seinfeld or voicing animated characters like her Wreck-It Ralph part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sarah-silverman-s-net-worth-is-modest-despite-wreck-it-ralph-s-insane-success-front-deposit-back-disneymusicvevo_youtube.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Silverman talked about I Smile Back</a> in an interview with Nick Allen from Roger Ebert's website. She said that she knows that people wonder if she can truly play certain characters since she's known for being funny. She explained, "Well, it’s a blessing and a curse. The curse part is—and I understand it—I’ve had directors tell me, 'well, I would cast you as this, but you’re a personality, and people feel like they know you. And I need someone where the audience can get lost in a character, and not just felt that’s Sarah Silverman the comedian.'"</p><p>While Sarah Silverman might not have an incredibly high net worth, she has an impressive career and has accomplished a lot, from landing big movie roles to publishing her 2010 memoir "The Bedwetter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXq0tcuvnKulkaPAbrrErWSwp6KptW7D0Z6apGWZqXqzrcupn6xlkqTFbrvFn6CcnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-about-army-of-the-dead-star-ella-purnell-s-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About 'Army Of The Dead' Star Ella Purnell's Net Worth">&larr;
