Sunrise Coigney Ruffalo is the wife to The Hulk's actor, Mark Ruffalo. While much is known about the green menace, little is known about the private life of the Ruffalo family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two pair manage to&nbsp;showcase the love that they have for each other whenever they set foot on a red carpet. Granted, this is one relationship that has seen hell, fire, and brimstones, but has still managed to survive longer than most of the&nbsp;Hollywood flings&nbsp;that have become the norm these days.</p><p>Wait, they've been through all that? Yes, and much more! This post will explore their careers, children, early life, and everything private about them - good and bad. So, read on.</p><h2 id=they-met-on-the-street-in-1998><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They Met On The Street In 1998</span></h2><p>Sadly, Sunrise and Mark didn't meet over a lab experiment. But, according to his narrative, as written by The Guardian, Mark Ruffalo met Sunrise Coigney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on the streets in 1998</a>, in what he called "a redemption". At the time, he was a torn man with a woman who just couldn't give up on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-a-5-year-age-gap><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They Have A 5-Year Age Gap</span></h2><p>Unlike the crazy Madonna figures that are quite the norm in Hollywood, Mark and Sunrise have a neat 5 year <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">age gap separating them</a>. According to her IMDb profile, Sunrise is the younger one in the relationship. She was born on September&nbsp;17th, 1972 while Mark Ruffalo was born on November&nbsp;22nd, 1967.</p><h2 id=they-have-three-children><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Have Three Children</span></h2><p>Mark and Sunrise Ruffalo have been blessed with three children â€“ Keen Ruffalo, Bella Noche, and Odette Ruffalo. And as it turns out, their dad is keen on them joining Hollywood and rising to the A-list. While talking to Entertainment Tonight, he revealed how his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kids had fun making a cameo</a> in the shooting of Thor Ragnarok.</p><h2 id=they-were-married-in-2000><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Were Married In 2000</span></h2><p>After meeting on the streets in 1998, it took two years before Sunrise Coigney finally said "yes" to our resident Hulk. Zimbio reports that the two got married in 2000 after Ruffalo almost missed to grab the lass for himself. As it turned out, one of his friends was also attracted to the lady.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coigney-was-a-french-american-actress><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Coigney Was A French-American Actress</span></h2><p>Coigney was also a budding actress by the time she met a struggling Mark Ruffalo. And while not in a bad mental state as he was, she was also still struggling to make a name for herself. IMDb reports that, once her career took off, she featured in several movies such as In the Cut and Line of Fire.</p><h2 id=coigney-turned-ruffalo-down-when-he-first-proposed><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Coigney Turned Ruffalo Down When He First Proposed</span></h2><p>Yes. The first time wasn't the right time. The Guardian reports that Mark Ruffalo, despite being highly convinced that he'd marry Sunrise, got turned down the first time he proposed. But instead of retreating and getting a new catch, Mark recollected himself and tried his luck once more. The second time was a charm.</p><h2 id=ruffalo-was-diagnosed-with-a-brain-tumor-in-2001><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ruffalo Was Diagnosed With A Brain Tumor In 2001</span></h2><p>Just one year after their nuptials, Mark's health was in trouble. To make matters worse, his career was only trying to gain traction, with big Hollywood gigs still far from reach. And at this time in 2001, Cancer Horizons reports that Mark was diagnosed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vestibular schwannoma</a>, a condition that almost put his life at risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-ruffalo-his-brother-died-in-2008><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Scott Ruffalo, His Brother, Died In 2008</span></h2><p>While the MCU was building up its characters and Mark Ruffalo was warming up for the biggest acting stint of his career, tragedy struck. Mark's brother, Scott Ruffalo, was shot in his flat at Beverly Hills. ABC News reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott succumbed to his injuries</a> after being rushed to the hospital.</p><h2 id=he-moved-his-family-from-hollywood-to-upstate-new-york><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Moved His Family From Hollywood To Upstate New York</span></h2><p>Where's the best place for the Hulk to raise his kids? Right in the middle of the city where he's fought aliens before.</p><p>Well, not really. Seeking to run away from the city life of Los Angeles, Mark Ruffalo moved his family to a rural farmland in upstate New York, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr. Really Did Assemble The Avengersâ€¦ He Convinced Mark Ruffalo To Become The Hulk!</a></span></p><h2 id=coigney-stood-by-ruffalo-during-his-toughest-time><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Coigney Stood By Ruffalo During His Toughest Time</span></h2><p>Sunrise Ruffalo has never run away from her husband when trouble strikes. Even before they were married, Sunrise was the beam of hope that helped Ruffalo gain confidence in his talent and career. She was also very supportive when he was battling a brain tumor. And most recently, she held his hand through the pain of losing his brother, who was murdered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coigney-quit-her-acting-career-to-raise-her-kids><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Coigney Quit Her Acting Career To Raise Her Kids</span></h2><p>Raising kids while you're busy gracing red carpets can be a difficult task. And for Sunrise Ruffalo, she had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put her acting career on hold</a> after she delivered their second child. She said that she could get a second chance at acting, but not at spending time with her kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Ruffalo Wasnâ€™t Sure If He Was The Right Guy To Play The Hulkâ€¦ But Things Worked Well</a></span></p><h2 id=coigney-has-set-her-eyes-on-being-an-entrepreneur><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Coigney Has Set Her Eyes On Being An Entrepreneur</span></h2><p>Now that her kids are quickly growing up, Sunrise Coigney is looking for a new flame to ignite her passions. And this time, it is entrepreneurship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to WWD</a>, she said that it's time for her to find ways to express herself creatively. Her first venture was a summer boutique named "Sunny's Callicoon Pop".</p><h2 id=ruffalo-hid-the-news-about-his-brain-tumor-from-his-wife><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ruffalo Hid The News About His Brain Tumor From His Wife</span></h2><p>After all that she went through raising him from his career low, Ruffalo thought Sunrise couldn't stomach the news about his brain tumor. So, he hid it from her. Worse still, Women Working reports that Sunrise was pregnant with their first child, which made the situation even more complicated for Mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Tom Holland And Robert Downey Jr. Friends In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=they-dated-for-2-years><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Dated For 2 Years</span></h2><p>If you thought Sunrise was supportive of Mark because she already knew he was the one, then you're mistaken. The couple dated for 2 years before they finally tied the knot. And, within these two years, Sunrise had turned down his proposal once, with Mark also feeling threatened by a friendâ€™s attraction to her.</p><h2 id=ruffalo-had-severe-side-effects-after-his-brain-surgery><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ruffalo Had Severe Side Effects After His Brain Surgery</span></h2><p>Luckily for Mark, he discovered his brain tumor when it was benign.
