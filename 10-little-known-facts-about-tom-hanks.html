After almost 40 years in the industry—appearing first on the silver screen in the 1980 slasher film, He Knows You’re Not Alone—Hanks has garnered a reputation as one of the most <a href=#>critically-acclaimed actors</a> in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Tom Hanks Movies of All Time</a></span></p><p>While Tom spends much of his time under the spotlight, there are a handful of little-known facts about this widely-known star. From his relation to one of America’s presidents (Hanks has royal blood?!) to his unique typewriter collection, there’s more to this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic celebrity</a>&nbsp;than what you see on the screen. Read on for a list of 10 nifty&nbsp;facts about Tom Hanks.</p><h2 id=hanks-is-related-to-abraham-lincoln>Hanks is related to Abraham Lincoln</h2><p>This big reveal has to kick off the list. While Hanks’s Hollywood acclaim might be regarded as royalty by some, Tom Hanks’s high rank runs blood-deep—this megastar is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">related to one of the greatest American presidents</a>, Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Hanks shared details of his presidential ancestry after announcing he would narrate the historical thriller, Killing Lincoln. He might not be of direct lineage—the 56-year-old actor is the third cousin, four times removed from Lincoln. But family ties are family ties, and, if we’re being as honest as Honest Abe would be? We see a bit of a resemblance!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hanks-has-type-2-diabetes>Hanks has type 2 diabetes</h2><p>It was in <a href=#>a 2013 interview with David Letterman</a> that Hanks publicized his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">type 2 diabetes diagnosis</a>. He joked about his history of high blood sugar, but recognized his behaviors as problematic, calling himself a “total idiot” when it comes to health and fitness.</p><p>He explained to Radio Times that he’s “part of the lazy <a href=#>American generation</a> that has blindly kept dancing through the party and now finds [himself] with a malady.” Hanks shares this ailment with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of well-known celebrities</a>, including Larry King and Salma Hayek.</p><h2 id=hanks-collects-typewriters>Hanks collects typewriters</h2><p>Some collect stamps. Some, baseball cards. Tom Hanks? Hanks collects typewriters. That’s right—Tom is an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">avid typewriter enthusiast</a>, his collection comprised of over 100 typewriters from around the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>You Collect What?: 10 Celebrities WithThe Most Bizarre Collections</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He began his collection in 1978 when he brought his plastic typewriter to a restorer who refused to repair the contraption. The restorer called Hanks’s plastic replica a “worthless toy,” and convinced him that quality typewriters are real, steel, durable machines. Hanks, enthralled, walked out of the store with a Hermes 2000—and thus began his obsession. Earning as much as he does, we’re sure he keeps a luxurious shrine for his 100+ typewriter collection!</p><h2 id=there-s-an-asteroid-named-after-him>There’s an asteroid named after him</h2><p>That’s right—this star is floating up in space, right where he belongs. After appearing in such films as Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan, Tom Hanks finally earned an honor that could shoot him to the moon: a main-belt Asteroid in his name, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12818 Tomhanks</a>.</p><p>Hanks was a longtime supporter of NASA and its manned space program—In fact, this space geek admitted his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">childhood obsession</a> with all things extraterrestrial. Reportedly, from Apollo 7 onward, “[he] lived on this stuff,” and was awaiting the day to play an astronaut. Well, not only has he received an Oscar for his role in Apollo 13&nbsp;but now his signature&nbsp;is perpetually floating in space! Talk about a destiny written in the stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hanks-went-through-a-whole-body-transformation-for-philadelphia>Hanks went through a whole-body transformation for 'Philadelphia'</h2><p>In the famous 1993 drama Philadelphia, Hanks plays a closeted gay lawyer who contracts AIDS, is fired from his job, and sues his former law firm over a civil liberties violation. Hanks went all out in preparing himself for the role, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">losing 35 pounds</a> to accurately portray Andy Beckett, the sickly attorney.</p><p>His is one of the most extreme transformations an actor has undergone in embodying a character. He even shaved his head to achieve the look of a man suffering from HIV. His fragility—his thinness and thinned hair—only added to his Oscar-winning performance as Beckett.</p><h2 id=before-hanks-lifted-off-as-an-actor-he-worked-as-a-hotel-bellman>Before Hanks lifted off as an actor, he worked as a hotel bellman</h2><p>Every celebrity has their “beginning” story—some were child actors, some (...many) served in restaurants while auditioning for their dream roles. Tom Hanks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started out as a bellboy</a>, working at Hilton hotels to make ends meet before he launched his acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t the most boring side job, though. While working as a hotel bellman, he got to meet some notable stars, including Cher, Sidney Poitier, and Slappy White. If you’re going to carry anyone’s luggage… well, it might as well be Cher’s!</p><h2 id=hanks-played-alongside-his-family-in-that-thing-you-do>Hanks played alongside his family in 'That Thing You Do!'</h2><p>That Thing You Do!, Hanks’s 1996 directorial debut, tells the story of a young band that achieves fame when their song tops the charts in 1964. Many know that Tom wrote, directed, and co-starred in the beloved cult classic. However, many don’t know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the movie included cameos of his whole family</a>.</p><p>Hanks’s wife, Rita Wilson, acts as a waitress in the movie; their son, Colin, plays an usher, escorting Liv Tyler; and their daughter, Elizabeth, can be spotted as a bored customer in a dress shop. Talk about a family affair!</p><h2 id=he-s-an-environmentalist>He’s an environmentalist</h2><p>Here’s one for the trees! This star is an <a href=#>ardent proponent of environmentalist</a>, and is known for his activity as an “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eco-celeb</a>.” He has long advocated for the use of electric cars, he himself owning a hybrid Scion XB—which was converted to run completely on electricity—along with two other eco-friendly digs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Are Environmentalism Activists</a></span></p><p>Hanks is also a volunteer for the Nature Conservancy. At one meeting, he described how “growing up in northern California has had a big influence on [his] love and respect for the outdoors.” He hopes to see more action taken on behalf of the earth’s conservation, so generations “can enjoy the same wonders [he] experienced as a boy.” You’re setting a great example, Mr. Hanks!</p><h2 id=he-and-bruce-springsteen-are-childhood-friends>He and Bruce Springsteen are childhood friends</h2><p>Hanks is <a href=#>a friendly face in Hollywood</a>, with several big names falling within his social circle. However, he’s actually been close friends with rockstar Bruce Springsteen since childhood, well before they first worked together on the film, Philadelphia.</p><p>Hanks moved around often as a child, having lived in over 10 different homes by the time he was 10 years old. One of his relocations led him to meeting Bruce—and the two buds hit it off. Later, Springsteen would write the iconic song, “The Streets of Philadelphia.” The film went on to win an Oscar for Best Original Song, as well as four <a href=#>Grammys</a>. Talk about a dynamic duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hanks-was-given-the-highest-civilian-award-from-the-us-navy>Hanks was given the highest civilian award from the US Navy</h2><p>Is there any award that this star hasn’t received? It’s true—Tom Hanks, along with other stars like Ellen DeGeneres and Michael Jordan, was presented the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2016 by then-president Barack Obama.</p><p>In receiving the nation’s highest civilian honor, Hanks and the other recipients were praised for both the work that made them famous, as well as their various charitable and humanitarian endeavors. With his environmentalist activity and his philanthropic work, the honor comes as no surprise. One question: With his Grammys, Oscars, his typewriter collection, and his Medal of Freedom, where does he find the space to store all of his things?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Facts You Never Knew About Mila Kunis</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5npKS6brTAp6KsZZyewbW4xGaip6eno3qnrcKtqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./american-weather-forum-list-of-american-weather-discussions-and-forums.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Weather Forum  List of American Weather Discussions and Forums">&larr;
