Some celebrities, like Val Kilmer, have found spacious spots away from cities where they feel they can get away. Some celebrities might choose to live in more than one place, or in a big city. Val Kilmer, however, decided to move to the desert, and discussed a few of the reasons during an interview with The Late Show host, David Letterman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kilmer-discussed-his-interesting-pets-during-the-rare-late-show-interview>Kilmer Discussed His Interesting Pets During The Rare Late Show Interview</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/val-kilmer.jpg><p>Some celebrities live in big cities, or even in more than one place.

The bull's name is James Brown, because he is the godfather."</p><p>Letterman appeared to enjoy hearing about Kilmer's buffalo. "And his companion is who?"</p><p>"Jezebel." Kilmer responded.</p><p>The host then wanted to know why Kilmer wanted the animals as pets. "What was it about...

"Yes, that's one of the reasons I moved to- I live in New Mexico."</p><p>"New Mexico," the host confirmed, "What part of New Mexico?"

Or (did you get them from somewhere else)?"</p><p>"No, and they're not so much extinct anymore, like the...hawk..." Kilmer replied, looking away.

"But I see you're bringing wildlife back into the city", he joked.</p><p>At one point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilmer had apparently angered his neighbors</a> for remarks he had made, for example, that "he lives 'in the homicide capital of the Southwest.'" However, Kilmer has said that "he was misquoted."</p><p>Kilmer purchased the property in 1996 and owned his New Mexico Ranch, which was around 6,000 acres, for decades.
