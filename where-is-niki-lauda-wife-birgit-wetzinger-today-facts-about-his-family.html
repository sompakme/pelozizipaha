Niki was also a consultant for Scuderia Ferrari and the Jaguar Formula One racing team’s team manager for two years.</p><p>Following that, Lauda worked as a commentator for German TV during Grand Prix weekends and served as non-executive chairman of Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, which he owned 10% of.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts></span>Quick Facts:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Andreas Nikolaus Lauda</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date Of Birth</strong></td><td>22 February 1949</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Demise</strong></td><td>20 May 2019 (aged 70)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Vienna, Austria</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Austrian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife</strong></td><td>Marlene Knaus (m. 1976-1991), Birgit Wetzinger (m. 2008)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Mathias, Lukas, Christoph, Mia, and Max.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$200 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=where-is-niki-lauda-wife-birgit-wetzinger-today><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-niki-lauda-wife-birgit-wetzinger-today></span> Where Is Niki Lauda Wife Birgit Wetzinger Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Niki Lauda lived in Vienna, Austria along with his wife Birgit Wetzinger and family before his demise. She and her family might still be living in their family home, as no updates about them have made it to the media.</p><p>The race driver’s wife appears to be a strong woman who has been able to pull herself together and live a happy life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-birgit-wetzinger></span>Who Is Birgit Wetzinger?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born on March 4, 1979, 43 years old Birgit Wetzinger is originally from Vienna, Austria.</p><p>Wetzinger is of the Indigenous Austrian legacy and follows Christianity as her religion. She is a former air hostess who became a flight attendant immediately after graduation. She even has an aviation certificate from a local college.</p><p>Her then-boyfriend, Niki Lauda, had renal disease and required a transplant less than a year after they began dating. While Niki requested a kidney test from his ex-wife, Marlene, the results were inconclusive.</p><p>She cared so much about Niki that she was willing to donate her kidney to him. Later, she requested that her tissue be tested to determine whether she may be a possible donor.</p><p>Niki disputed it, but Birgit claimed for three months that she would finally give her kidney to the ex-BMW M1 Procar Championship champion. Following that, the procedure was a success.</p><p>The racer’s kidney condition was a long-term result of his 1976 German Grand Prix, Nurburgring accident, in which he received severe burns to his head and lungs. As a result, Lauda had to get two kidney transplants.</p><h2 id=niki-lauda-birgit-wetzingers-married-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=niki-lauda-birgit-wetzingers-married-life></span> Niki Lauda & Birgit Wetzinger’s Married Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Birgit Witzenger had just turned 29 when the pair met in 2004, but &nbsp;Niki Lauda was already 59. The racer did not meet Witzenger while traveling, as in the 2013 film.</p><p>Instead, the pair met at a party and fell in love, according to Lauda. The racing driver, on the other hand, did take her someplace shortly after their initial meeting.</p><p>The pair ran into each other at a party. Witzenger was unfamiliar with Lauda . She mistook him for a tennis player and she worked as a flight attendant for Niki’s airline at the time.</p><p>He founded his airline shortly after quitting racing for the second time in 1985. However, the airline ceased operations in April 2013.</p><p>In an interview, the racer claimed that he was immediately drawn to Birgit because of her boots. It was the first thing that piqued his attention in her, Niki said.</p><p>He said he had no idea Birgit worked for his firm.&nbsp;He proposed to Birgit in a restaurant in Ibiza two months before the wedding.</p><p>On August 25, 2008, at half past three p.m., the couple married in front of close family and friends at the Vienna Wahring register office.</p><p>On his special day, Lauda wore a red hat and jeans. Among the witnesses are his longtime lawyer and friend Haig Asenbauer, as well as several relatives and friends. Following the wedding, the pair traveled to the Balearic island of Ibiza for a week.&nbsp;</p><p>They had a beautiful married life together and were both fortunate to have found one other as their life partner.</p><h2 id=niki-lauda-had-five-children-mathias-lukas-christoph-mia-and-max><span class=ez-toc-section id=niki-lauda-had-five-children-mathias-lukas-christoph-mia-and-max></span> Niki Lauda Had Five Children: Mathias, Lukas, Christoph, Mia, and Max<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The family of F1 Racer Niki Lauda is blessed with five children, where&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathias-lauda></span>Mathias Lauda&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mathias is a racing driver who currently competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship for Aston Martin Racing as a factory driver.

Despite being a celebrity child, Lukas has always kept a low profile when it comes to media appearances. On April 5, 1979, Lukas was born.</p><p>He was named after his father, Niki’s best friend Luca Montezemolo. He was the Sporting Director with whom he spent the first two spectacular years of his Ferrari career.</p><p>The racing driver’s son is of mixed ethnicity.

When he raced in that year’s Monaco Grand Prix, he piqued Enzo Ferrari’s interest and joined the Ferrari team in 1974.&nbsp;</p><p>He finished second in his debut race for Ferrari, the Argentine Grand Prix, and won the Spanish Grand Prix the following year. In 1975, Lauda won four races in the new Ferrari 312T, then finished third in the Italian Grand Prix and first in the US Grand Prix.</p><p>He said during practice for the 1979 Canadian Grand Prix that he was no longer interested in continuing “the folly of going around in circles” and would be quitting immediately. After being promised $3 million pay to join the McLaren team, Niki came out of retirement in 1982.</p><p>He won the 1982 Long Beach Grand Prix and the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix before breaking his wrist during the 1985 Belgian Grand Prix practice.</p><p>He announced his retirement from racing at the end of the 1985 season.
