This is likely because he lived in the same home in New Jersey for decades and did not spend frivolously. The next big purchase that Pesci will likely make will be to purchase his dream home in California, given that his New Jersey mansion sold for $5 million in 2022. But, from the sights of things, Pesci will be well taken care of, even if he never works a day again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-joe-pesci-39-s-net-worth-now>What Is Joe Pesci's Net Worth Now?</h2><h3 id=joe-pesci-has-made-his-fortune-from-his-acting-career>Joe Pesci has made his fortune from his acting career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar29708129-1.jpg><p><strong>Pesci is worth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">about $50 million</a> in 2024.

Then he appeared in Easy Money (1983), Half Nelson (1985), and Lethal Weapon 2 (1989).</p><p>However, in 1990, he got one of his most famous characters, gangster Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas.
