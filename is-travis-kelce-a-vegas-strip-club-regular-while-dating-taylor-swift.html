Many are "tired" of seeing them on their social media feeds, while others don't think they're really in love with each other. The football star himself <a href=#>denied they were getting serious</a>.</p><p>In November 2023, the Kansas City Chief's tight-end was also seen wearing a T-shirt that said, "Crazy Horse 3 Las Vegas." It's the name of a popular strip club close to the Raiders' home stadium. This was months before <a href=#>Kelce's mom hinted at him joining Swift's Eras Tour</a>.</p><p>Now, the <strong><a href=#>musician</a></strong>'s fans are worried about her. The couple's recent NFL outing also sparked speculation that Swift had started to get the "ick" on Kelce after his viral victory chant. Here's a closer look at their <a href=#>controversial relationship, which the singer is reportedly unsure of</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-11t143656-298.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Fans Were Furious Over The Alleged "Ego" Rule She Enforced On New Hires</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's apparent rules for her employees has caused tension among Swifties.</span><h2 id=is-travis-kelce-still-visiting-strip-clubs-while-dating-taylor-swift>Is Travis Kelce Still Visiting Strip Clubs While Dating Taylor Swift?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar51800469.jpg><p>Per Marca's report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce's Crazy Horse T-Shirt can only be bought inside the club</a>. The establishment also refused to comment on the matter following their guest privacy policy. So we'll never really know. The whole thing blew up as Swift has long-maintained her "America's Sweetheart" image.</p><p>Early in February 2024, TMZ reported that the Love Story hitmaker and her beau were being courted by a Vegas strip club to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"party their faces off"</a> if the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Owned by Larry Flynt, the Hustler Club in Las Vegas invited the couple for a "Topless Touchdown Celebratory Package" that costs $1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The package includes "unlimited access to the $10K per hour Mohney Suite, an Ace of Spades champagne bottle parade, and $50K for Taylor and Travis to make it rain," said the news outlet. Aside from a "roundtrip limo transportation," the couple also get a "VIP Platinum Lifetime Membership" A.K.A. a lifetime of free lap dances.</p><p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ended up partying at XS Nightclub in Las Vegas post-Super Bowl until 5 a.m. when they were spotted eating chicken fingers together.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/travis-kelce-los-angeles-premiere-of-quarterback-taylor-swift-mtv-video-music-awards-2023.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce Feels Pressure To Keep Up With Taylor Swift As She Continues To Break Records</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce opened up about how being with someone so successful can be intimidating, and how he puts a lot of pressure on himself.</span><h2 id=is-taylor-swift-amp-travis-kelce-39-s-relationship-a-pr-stunt>Is Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce's Relationship A PR Stunt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiefs' owner Clark Hunt finally weighed in</a> on the rumors that Kelce and Swift's romance was just a PR stunt. During an appearance on Mad Money on CNBC, Hunt said they were the "real deal" and that they were all "so happy" for the athlete. "Well, first of all, we're so happy for Travis Kelce and Taylor in their relationship. I've had a chance to meet her at one of the many games that she's attended this year," said the Chiefs' CEO.</p><p>He continued: "She's just as sweet as she can be. I also got to see her play here [at our Arrowhead Stadium] twice this past summer and what an incredible performer. I mean, just one of the most incredible artists of our time." So it's no wonder Swift "organically" increased their female audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's been a very interesting, very fun year having the two of them dating," Hunt explained. "The attention that's been focused on the Chiefs, our female audience has grown leaps and bounds. That's right, it was purely organic."</p><p>"You know, when they were just starting off dating, there were a lot of people saying, 'Oh, it's a marketing stunt,' but no, it's very real," Hunt said of Kelce and Swift's relationship.</p><p>In conclusion, the Chiefs' boss said "the most important thing is we're happy for the two of them." Here's a timeline of Kelce and Swift's relationship.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>July 2023</p></td><td><p>Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour; he said on his podcast that he tried talking to her backstage but found out she wasn't talking to anybody after a long performance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>September 14, 2023</p></td><td><p>Kelce refused to disclose whether Swift had reached out to him after his missed shot at meeting her</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>September 24, 2023</p></td><td><p>Swift surprised everyone when she watched the Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears live in Kelce's suite with his mom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2023</p></td><td><p>After two more football game appearances, Swift was seen holding hands with Kelce after their separate <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> cameos; a photo of them kissing went viral</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2023</p></td><td><p>Kelce shared more details about Swift reaching out to him</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>December 2023</p></td><td><p>Swift said it was "metal as hell" when Kelce put her on blast after his podcast shoutout</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 1, 2024</p></td><td><p>Kelce and Swift sealed 2023 with a New Year kiss during a party</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 21, 2024</p></td><td><p>Kelce's brother <a href=#>Jason made a "cringe" scene</a> after meeting Swift for the first time</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 28, 2024</p></td><td><p>Kelce was filmed saying "I love you" to Swift minutes after his team won against the Baltimore Ravens at the AFC Championship game, which secured their Super Bowl spot</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 11, 2024</p></td><td><p>Kelce and Swift had a PDA-filled Super Bowl where <a href=#>Lana Del Rey got assaulted</a> as their group celebrated the Chiefs' win</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:16</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-isn-t-the-only-artist-who-has-turned-down-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Isn't The Only Artist Who Has Turned Down The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift isn't the only musician who has turned down the Super Bowl Halftime Show, with other big-name artists also saying no to the gig.</span><h2 id=taylor-swift-might-have-gotten-the-quot-ick-quot-on-travis-kelce-39-s-super-bowl-antics>Taylor Swift Might Have Gotten The "Ick" On Travis Kelce's Super Bowl Antics</h2><p>Amid their PDA moments at the Super Bowl, fans noticed that Swift might have gotten the "ick" on Kelce after he chanted, "Viva Las Vegas" over and over during the trophy ceremony. In the video below, you can see the Lover songstress' expression change from proud to unsure. "Taylor swift definitely got the ick 3 seconds into travis kelce's speech," someone wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another one noted: "Bro no way Travis Kelce just gave Taylor Swift the ick live in tv in front of millions of viewers. I believe in the Ick now." Still, Kelce's fans came to his defense, saying he was just happy about their victory. "Taylor Swift fans saying she got the ick from Travis Kelce yelling 'Viva las vegas' over and over. Brother, If I won a superbowl I'd be up there with my shirt off and slapping my balls on the mic for all I care," said a netizen.</p><p>Dr. Louise Mahler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a body language expert, also weighed in on the issue</a>, saying that the 14-time Grammy winner was "embarrassed" and was "being polite" throughout the viral footage.</p><p>"We can imagine how anyone super excited may have expressed themselves like this, but I think she was horrified, slightly amused, but embarrassed," the body language expert said of Swift's "ick" moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mahler added: "When one sees Taylor Swift at the Grammys [you can tell] she is totally elated by her colleagues' wins. She jumps up and down and laughs and calls out. In this footage, she opens, then shuts and holds her mouth tightly. She does not want to open it, suggesting she does not want to say something. Her mouth is slightly smiling, but her eyes lose their sparkle. She is being polite."</p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win might have just proved that <a href=#>the "Taylor Swift Curse"</a> isn't real.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lkWLDprPArGSsrKKevW6vy66ZZqqVnMKtrdFmrqGhnJp6pa3ToqWgZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mike-o-malley-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike O'Malley Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
