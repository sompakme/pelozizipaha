Made up of <a href=#>Sporty, Baby, Ginger, Scary, and Posh Spice</a>, the British artists redefined girl bands and paved the way for girl groups to market to teenage girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their music is still popular nearly 30 years later, and even though the five singers no longer perform together as a group, they are considered British icons to this day.</p><p>Along with their chart-topping music and legendary costumes, the girls drew attention over the years for their friendships with one another. The friendship with the most ups and downs may be that of Victoria Beckham and Mel B, who reunited in London in 2022.</p><p>With publications reporting that <a href=#>Beckham will never sing with the Spice Girls again</a>, fans have wondered where her friendship with Mel B stands today.</p><h2 id=what-was-victoria-beckham-and-mel-b-rsquo-s-relationship-like-in-the-spice-girls>What Was Victoria Beckham And Mel B’s Relationship Like In The Spice Girls?</h2><p>After their formation in 1995, the Spice Girls became the biggest girl group in the world and one of the most popular music acts of all time.</p><p>Their upbeat pop music and unique costumes defined an entire generation and the five women—Melanie Chisholm (Melanie C), Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Brown (Mel B) and Victoria Beckham—became global superstars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Spice Girl Mel C Rips Into Victoria Beckham For Bad Lip-Syncing</a></span></p><p>The five singers formed a bond that came from the strange experience they shared of being part of a pop phenomenon. But their relationships weren’t perfect, and they did have individual arguments and issues between them.</p><p>According to Closer, Mel B revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her friendship with Victoria Beckham</a> became strained soon after their founding in 1995, when the group took a trip to Hawaii, so they could bond. During the trip, Mel B had a fling who defecated on the beach and rinsed himself in the water, which grossed out Beckham.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Doesn’t he know what a toilet is? It’s disgusting,” Beckham reportedly told Mel B. The incident ignited tension in their friendship, which was soon plagued by rumors that the ladies didn’t get along.</p><p>Mel B reportedly called Beckham “pretentious” and told her friends she would “never get along” with her, while Beckham is believed to have called Mel “abrasive”.</p><h2 id=did-a-potential-spice-girls-reunion-cause-more-strain>Did A Potential Spice Girls Reunion Cause More Strain?</h2><p>The friendship between the two was also reportedly strained in 2018 and 2019, when Beckham appeared to decline to join her former bandmates for a reunion.</p><p>“There’s one that’s been a bit difficult,” Mel said on Loose Women about getting the girls back together for a tour. “But I’m hoping she’s going to get roped in.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Tragic Details About The Spice Girls' Lives Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><p>Even though she didn’t confirm who she was talking about, fans and the show hosts gathered that she was talking about Beckham.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Wonderwall, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beckham was “infuriated” with Mel</a> for talking publicly about a reunion when she had never given her approval or suggested that she was willing to be part of it.</p><p>“Victoria was always up for a catch-up and the prospect of a celebration of the band’s work, but going out on the road for concerts was never something she agreed to,” a source shared. “Every time Mel makes promises to the fans it leaves Victoria looking like a killjoy who is stopping it from happening and that just isn’t fair.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Their relationship is in a bad place,” the source went on. “Victoria and her team see Mel as a loose cannon, who just says anything about the Spices, true or not, to get attention. The problem is that anything that is talked about in private could go public by Mel—and that can be problematic.”</p><h2 id=mel-b-and-victoria-beckham-rsquo-s-friendship-today>Mel B And Victoria Beckham’s Friendship Today</h2><p>Though there have been reports of a rocky relationship between the two Spice Girls for years, fans were delighted when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel B and Victoria Beckham reunited in 2022.</a></p><p>Mel received a Member of the Order of the British Empire Award for <a href=#>her work with the UK charity Women’s Aid</a>, and Beckham supported her former bandmate by designing her dress for the occasion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Beloved Spice Girl Almost Wasn't In The Band, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>On Instagram, Mel revealed that Beckham styled her and her mom, Andrea Brown, but was also physically present to help them get ready, rather than leaving the task to staff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My spice sister vic, I can't thank you enough for your enormous generosity," Mel wrote in a post of herself and Beckham after the ceremony. "Not only did you dress me and my mum but you surprised me by actually being there to fit us…….it was just soooooooo special thanks to YOU and your fabulousness."</p><p>Beckham also organized a dinner for both stars and their families to celebrate Mel’s achievement. According to E! News, Mel dedicated her award to “all the other women” suffering from domestic violence.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Which Spice Girl Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dq7akwM6roJplkpqwrLTApmSmnZxir26%2F06KjpWWWp7amusOsZKyomZiybrPIq6OsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./corey-kluber-girlfriend-turned-wife-when-did-he-marry-amanda-kluber.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corey Kluber Girlfriend Turned Wife- When Did He Marry Amanda Kluber?">&larr;
