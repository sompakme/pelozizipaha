Each time they broke up, the hearts of their fans everywhere broke with them. Fans followed their story passionately, eagerly awaiting the next tidbit of news. When the picture-perfect couple finally decided to get married, fans rejoiced with them, but the celebration was short-lived as they divorced six months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Worth Of The 10 Biggest Disney Child Stars</a></span></p><p>That’s not to say they haven’t had some beautiful moments together over the past ten years, defining the idea of relationship goals. Here, we look at ten times Miley and Liam were couple goals.</p><h2 id=when-they-met-filming-a-nicholas-sparks-movie>When They Met Filming a Nicholas Sparks Movie</h2><p>Most relationships have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cute origin story</a> attached to them, but Miley and Liam take this to the next level entirely. They met filming <i>The Last Song</i>, a film made from a novel written by none other than romance master Nicholas Sparks.</p><p>What’s really amusing about this whole scenario is that Miley wasn’t sure how she felt about Liam at first, having heard rumors that he didn’t really want the role as her co-star. However, by the second round of auditions, the air was cleared between the two...and love filled the empty space! They became fast friends and things snowballed from there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=any-time-they-wear-coordinated-holiday-outfits>Any Time they Wear Coordinated Holiday Outfits</h2><p>When it comes to the holidays, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have relationship goals in the bag! The couple decided to coordinate their attire for a holiday party they attended with Liam’s brother Chris Hemsworth and his wife. The two chose to wear classic “ugly” Christmas sweaters, but failed to make them look ugly!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Miley Cyrus Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Miley rocked a birthday Jesus on hers, choosing to further accessorize with a giant sequin bow in her hair and a light-up necklace resembling a string of lights. With their stark difference in size and vastly different personalities and energies, it’s always amusing to see the two sporting carefully coordinated clothing.</p><h2 id=when-they-bonded-over-their-mutual-love-for-animals>When They Bonded Over their Mutual Love for Animals</h2><p>For some people, meeting someone who says they have nine pets at home might be an immediate turnoff, but that was not the case for Miley and Liam. Miley’s personal zoo grew over the years of her relationship with Liam to include nine dogs, three cats, and a miniature potbellied pig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It began in 2012 when they adopted their first two dogs, a pit bull and a Rottweiler-beagle mix. The pair could often be spotted taking some of their personal dog pack for a walk together. Hemsworth would also help her take care of them at home, making this aspect of their relationship serious relationship goals.</p><h2 id=every-time-they-exchanged-gifts>Every Time they Exchanged Gifts</h2><p>It can be really difficult to shop for a loved one, especially when they have a lot of disposable income, but Liam Hemsworth is too creative to let that get in his way. For <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his love’s 25th birthday</a>, he got her a unique necklace and earring set by Sydney Evan sporting gemstones with her favorite color combination: rainbow.</p><p>Adding to the cuteness, the gem-studded necklace was personalized to read “Lili,” which is Miley’s nickname for Liam. He rounded out the rainbow-themed gift with a beautiful bouquet of rainbow flowers. Thoughtful, creative, and right up Miley’s alley - definitely worthy of relationship goals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-liam-calls-miley-his-angel>When Liam Calls Miley “His Angel”</h2><p>Truth be told, he did this a lot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam has referred to Miley</a> as his angel many times over on social media and interviews alike. Whether it was praising her for a recent success or captioning a sweet photo of the pair, it practically became a habit of his.</p><p>In the world of pet names for a significant other, angel is a pretty nice choice. Miley’s responses to these adorable comments were equally as endearing and usually came decorated with heart and smiley emojis. These two certainly knew how to show their affection for one another while creating relationship goals.</p><h2 id=when-liam-met-miley-s-family>When Liam Met Miley’s Family</h2><p>Meeting your significant other’s family can’t be any easier when you already have the spotlight on you, but Liam Hemsworth turned a potentially awkward situation into relationship goals when he met Miley’s family. Miley comes from a family with many siblings including her older brother Trace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Trace first met Liam, he really didn’t want to like him and was fully prepared to be the stereotypical bully of an older brother. However, when they met, Trace said it just wasn’t possible to not like the guy. He credits their relationship success with their down-to-earth attitudes. Relationships are so much easier when everyone gets along!</p><h2 id=when-liam-pranks-miley>When Liam Pranks Miley</h2><p>Having a relationship where pranks are an integral component are serious relationship goals. Liam Hemsworth seems to have taken this to heart, as he seems to spend a good portion of his relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley</a> filming pranks he pulled on her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Worth Of The 10 Biggest Disney Child Stars</a></span></p><p>From the simple jump scare around many corners to random shrieks to send chills down her spine, Liam is certainly a prankster with great timing skills. Miley claims that she can’t compete because she’s too loud of a person and can’t sneak up on people as well as Liam can. However, she had professional help on an episode of <i>Punk’d</i> where she finally got him back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-two-hit-the-red-carpet-together>When They Two Hit the Red Carpet Together</h2><p>Something they surprisingly don’t do as often as we would think, when Miley and Liam <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">walk the red carpet together</a> they are relationship goals personified. At the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> premiere, they were very obviously fond of each other, getting caught being touchy-feely more than once.</p><p>Miley reportedly showed Liam off like a prize as the two posed for paparazzi photos together. At one point, she was caught on video licking Liam or pretending to at least. That’s one way to show your affection! At least the chemistry between the two is mutual, with Liam going in for a tickle at one point that night.</p><h2 id=when-miley-gushes-about-liam-online>When Miley Gushes about Liam Online</h2><p>After the two walked the red carpet together at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> premiere, Miley made sure the online community knew exactly how much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appreciation she had for Liam</a>. Later that night, she made a variety of posts on social media featuring extremely flattering photos of Liam, describing him as a #snack in the caption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She goes on to describe how obsessed with him she was at the time, not sparing any words at expressing how attractive she found him. Liam shared a little love for Miley that night as well, posting photos of himself and his “hot date” the night of the premier.</p><h2 id=when-they-married-after-losing-their-home>When They Married After Losing Their Home</h2><p>Mother nature doesn’t care how famous you are or how much money you have, and this was made evident when Miley reported that she and Liam’s home in Malibu had been destroyed by the wildfires that had ravaged the area.</p><p>The home was worth around $2.5 million. Thankfully, both Miley and Liam and their hoard of animals all escaped the fire unscathed, but the structure did not survive the flames. Something like that could destroy even the most perfect relationship, and the two came out stronger than ever before and decided to get married, citing losing the home as to what sparked the decision.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10 Most Expensive Guitars in the World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnZ65psWMnLCrraNiuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMdmmqitoKGybrPOmqOsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alex-meraz-wife-kim-meraz-is-the-mother-of-their-two-children-somak-and-talus-alexander-meraz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Meraz Wife Kim Meraz Is The Mother of Their Two Children Somak and Talus Alexander Meraz">&larr;
