The best way to do this is to use a soap that ensures the bad stuff gets washed away but keeps the healthy cells intact. Clean, hydrated skin that is well cared for not only has an effect on how your skin looks; it also helps protect your overall health. That’s why choosing the right antibacterial soap for your skin is vital. The appropriate body wash, how you use it and protecting your skin are all part of overall health and vitality.</p><p>It’s estimated that our skin plays host to approximately 1,000 different species of bacteria. All over our body, healthy bacteria live together with cells that make up the skin’s microbiome. Many antibacterial soaps wash away all bacteria and natural oils, leaving the skin vulnerable and dry. Cleansing skin is a critical step in skin care, so the type of soap used, and the ingredients it contains, should be chosen carefully.</p><p>Antibacterial agents, including the chemicals found in soaps and hand sanitizers, have been in household and commercial cleaning products for decades. In the 1950s and 1960s, antibacterial soaps were frequently marketed as deodorant soaps because they eliminated the bacteria that can cause body odor. While the antibacterial soaps of today are designed to kill germs and cleanse the skin, overuse of antibacterial soap and certain ingredients can cause irritation and dryness.</p><p>You might be thinking: If bacteria are part of our microbiome, why is it important to get rid of bacteria on the skin? One reason you should care about bacteria is because it causes body odor. When bacteria on your skin comes into contact with sweat, it can create some pretty nasty odors. An antibacterial body wash can help wash these germs away, leaving skin clean and ensuring you smell fresh.</p><p>Antibacterial soaps can be particularly helpful for anyone suffering from acne. While acne is caused by clogged pores, inflammation or red, bumpy areas can be a result of too much bacteria on the skin. Many people get “bacne,” which is acne on the back and shoulders, and using antibacterial soap can keep these breakouts at bay.</p><h2>Microbiome Management</h2><p>A healthy microbiome ensures that your skin is working to fight off irritants that can harm your skin. What makes skin microbiomes healthy is diversity. A microbiome is made up of trillions of different types of bacteria, all existing on different layers of the skin. It’s a healthy balance of bacteria, fungi, viruses and mites. While that may sound alarming, these different organisms play important roles in the skin’s immunity, healing power, health and hydration. A healthy skin microbiome is like the control center of the skin: When it is disrupted or out of balance, skin issues can arise.</p><p>There are many factors that determine the health of your skin’s microbiome. The skin on different parts of your body has different levels of activity of the microbiome. Your scalp, for instance, will have different types of microbial species than your arms or legs. Climate, pollution, hormones and even what you eat all have an effect on your skin’s microbiome.</p><p>Why is it important to eliminate bad bacteria but protect healthy bacteria on the skin? Bacterial infections can be harmful, and even deadly. While bacterial infections are usually treated early and do not pose too much of a health threat, some bacterial infections of the skin can cause issues, especially when they travel to organs inside the body. Something as simple as a bug bite leading to excessive scratching can lead to skin infections. For this reason, it’s important to protect the skin with skin care that helps it do its important job of protecting the body.</p><p>Bacterial infections on the skin are easily spread. Treating bacterial infections requires antibiotic cream and ointments, and can take time. The best way to deal with a skin infection is to prevent it in the first place. Washing skin thoroughly and maintaining a healthy skin habit is the first line of defense when it comes to avoiding infections. Luckily, there are hundreds of deep-cleansing body soaps to choose from.</p><p>While antibacterial soaps have been formulated to kill bacteria, preserving the skin’s delicate balance of organisms is necessary to maintain its health. Many antibacterial soaps contain harsh chemicals that not only kill good bacteria but may also be harmful to the body. One ingredient, triclosan, has been shown in some studies to alter the way hormones work in your body. Other ingredients such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxylenol, both of which can cause damage to the eyes, are often found in antibacterial soaps.</p><h2>Antibacterial Agents</h2><p>Nature has provided a few ways to eliminate harmful bacteria. Natural oils like lemongrass, eucalyptus, peppermint and rosemary are a few powerful antibacterial agents. While effectively helping kill bacteria, natural oils also help nourish skin because they contain beneficial vitamins. Natural oils have been used in skin care and wellness regimes for thousands of years.</p><p>Where natural oils aren’t used, manufactured ingredients that cleanse the skin can be helpful. Some of these are formulated to act similarly to natural ingredients, and are more cost effective for use in mass-produced products.</p><p>It’s time to take a look at the 13 best antibacterial soaps in 2023. Some contain all-natural ingredients and others have chemically manufactured ingredients, but all have antibacterial properties to kill germs. In this list, we’ve gathered the best body washes for eliminating bacteria from the skin, as well as ingredients that help the skin stay healthy and nourished. Cleansing, hydrating and keeping your skin’s naturally healthy microbiome intact are all part of the process of choosing an antibacterial body wash that’s right for you.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Body Wash</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-antibacterial-soaps-blu-atlas.jpg><p>This gel body wash transforms into a rich, foamy lather that thoroughly cleans the skin and washes bacteria, oil, dirt and grime down the drain.

Although abundant bacteria live on the skin, harmful bacteria can flourish and cause issues if proper antibacterial cleansing isn’t part of your daily routine.</p><p>For instance, hand washing with quality soap for at least 20 seconds is vital for overall health. Harmful germs and bacteria are only removed from the hands after 20 seconds of scrubbing. Any less than that means you may not be removing all the germs on your hands, which can cause illness after touching bacteria-laden items like raw poultry, bathroom fixtures or even your phone.</p><p>The two most common types of bacteria that cause skin infections are <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. These bacteria cause skin infections that can require prescription medication to treat. Types of skin infections such as athlete’s foot, impetigo, MRSA infections and bacterial folliculitis can be caused by bacteria that make their way into the skin through microscopic cuts, wounds or breaks in the skin. Thoroughly washing the skin is the best way to avoid skin infections caused by bacteria.</p><h3>Proper Antibacterial Washing All Over</h3><p>The body wash you use is important, but so is how you use it. While there’s no definitive guide on how to shower, there are few things to keep in mind when it comes to getting clean all over. First, remember to use warm water in the shower or bath. Very hot water can dry out the skin, which can lead to microscopic tears where bacteria can find their way in. While a super-hot shower may feel like you’re getting clean, you risk stripping your skin of natural oils.</p><p>Towels are another consideration. Make sure towels are clean and dry for use after each bathing session. In one study, it was found that 90% of bathroom towels were contaminated with dead skin cells and bacteria, including the menacing <i>E. coli</i>, which can cause urinary tract infections and digestive complications. Bath towels need to be hung and dried thoroughly after use because bacteria love damp, dark environments. Make sure you’re using a clean, dry towel and hang it up between each use. How often should you wash your towel? Experts say washing towels once every three to four days is optimal.</p><p>And don’t forget about washcloths, loofahs and sponges. Whether you use your hands or another material to wash your body is a matter of personal preference. But if you do use a washcloth, sponge or loofah, make sure they air dry completely between showers. Change washcloths frequently and wash them with your bath towels. As for sponges and loofahs, swap them out for new, clean ones about every three to four weeks. And if you ever notice mold growing in your sponge or loofah, throw it away.</p><p>After cleansing and drying, you should moisturize. Using an all-over body moisturizer helps keep skin hydrated and there’s less chance of dryness and infection when skin is healthy. Just like body washes, there are many options when it comes to body moisturizers. Whether you have sensitive skin or dry skin, whether you prefer no scent or want all the scents, there’s a good pick for you. By reading ingredients and choosing a moisturizer that can keep your skin balanced, you’re maintaining your skin’s overall health.</p><p><strong>Not done shopping?
