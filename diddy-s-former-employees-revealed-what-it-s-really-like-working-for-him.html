Diddy's career in music began as an intern at Uptown Records before he started his successful record label, Bad Boy Records. After hit singles and million-dollar business investments, Diddy became a pop culture icon and Hip-Hop’s third billionaire with over<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $1 billion net worth.</a></p><p>However, recent allegations against Diddy have shown that things weren't always as glamorous as they appeared. In 2023, Diddy's longtime ex-girlfriend,<strong> </strong>Cassie Ventura<strong>,</strong> filed a lawsuit<a href=#> exposing the mogul for sexual, physical and emotional abuse</a> during their relationship.

From what employees close to him, like his chef, nanny, company employees and bodyguards, have said in recent years, it is not as pleasant as one might think. Here's what it's like working for P. Diddy and why many of his past employees have sued him for harassment, abuse, and discrimination.</p><h2 id=diddy-39-s-bodyguards-witnessed-domestic-abuse-while-working-for-him>Diddy's Bodyguards Witnessed Domestic Abuse While Working For Him</h2><p>According to one of Diddy's former bodyguards, Roger Bonds, working for the Diddy was traumatizing for him on several occasions. Bonds revealed several instances when he witnessed P. Diddy assaulting<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his ex-girlfriend, Cassie, and other women.</a> Cassie Ventura's lawsuit detailed one moment in 2009, when Diddy was stomping on her face in the car, and Bonds tried to intervene and de-escalate the situation but was not successful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After they arrived at Combs' home, Cassie tried to run away, but he followed her and kicked her in the face before she was ushered into the house, where she proceeded to vomit as a result of the assault. In a video clip Roger Bonds posted to his since-deleted Instagram page, he said, “I was sick of having to cover up everything that you did. I was sick.”</p><p>Another former bodyguard, Gene Deal, said he witnessed Combs assault his late wife, Kim Porter, on more than one occasion. He said one night, while they were at Porter's home, Diddy attacked her, and she defended herself with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">corkscrew that ripped his wrists up. </a>She hit an artery, and when she did that, Diddy had to rush over to St. Luke Hospital.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=several-of-diddy-39-s-former-employees-sued-him-for-discrimination>Several Of Diddy's Former Employees Sued Him For Discrimination</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/diddy.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Diddy's Popular Businesses</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Bad Boy Entertainment</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Revolt TV</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Aquahydrate</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sean Jon Clothing Line</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The No Way Out rapper knows little about loyalty, especially to those who have worked for him for years.

Spero, who had been working for Diddy since 1998 at Bad Boy Entertainment as an executive, claimed she was fired because of her age and health problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the suit, Spero, who was 51 at the time, said she was fired after undergoing hip surgery and confiding in another executive that she was being treated for drug dependency relapse. However, Diddy’s representative denied the claims but settled the million-dollar suit in 2011.</p><p>In 2017, five ex-employees of P. Diddy's Revolt TV sued him for terminating their employment because they were old and white. As per the suit, the producers who worked on shows like The Howard Stern Show accused Diddy and his staff of reverse racism. According to PageSix, Revolt TV's executive vice president would be rude and condescending to Caucasian staff while disregarding African-American <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">employees who came to work drunk or hungover.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=diddy-39-s-former-chef-spoke-out-about-harassment-while-working-for-him>Diddy's Former Chef Spoke Out About Harassment While Working For Him</h3><p>According to one of Diddy's former personal chefs, Cindy Rueda, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she experienced sexual harassment</a> while working for Diddy in his California home.
