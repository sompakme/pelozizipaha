In 2019, he was dubbed by Forbes as the 15th highest-paid celebrity, according to <a href=#>Amo Mama.</a> It has been reported that Johnson <a href=#>makes $20 million per movie </a>and $700,000 per episode of HBO's Ballers. With all that success, he has an assortment of mansions spread out across the country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's safe to say that Johnson has <a href=#>mansions o</a>n every coast and that his luxury homes are nothing to bat an eye at. The former wrestler turned actor has a knack for investing in property and then quickly selling it. Below you will find Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's $100 million mansions, worth ranked.</p><h1>$9.5 million</h1><p>In Powder Springs, Georgia, Johnson has reportedly paid the full price for his French country manor with 46 acres, a horse stall barn, and a restored farmhouse dating back to 1867.</p><p>This Southern down-home country abode is private enough to offer a getaway from the glitz and glamour. The exterior isn't just impressive-- this mansion is equipped with 8 bedrooms, 6 spacious bathrooms, and 3 half-baths. Also inside is a cozy library, multiple lounges, and beautiful fireplaces.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Mansion Global,</a>&nbsp;the Jumanji actor listed the Georgia mansion for&nbsp;$7.5 million dollars last month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h1>$5 million</h1><p>When Johnson is working in Los Angeles, he needs a place to unwind and recoup. Dubbed as one of his most luxurious homes according to <a href=#>YouTube</a>, the $5 million dollar mansion in Hidden Hills hosts a spacious outdoor area for parties.</p><p>The California home also has its <a href=#>very own professional gym</a>, boosts a giant master bedroom, and spacious car garage. He sold this superstar home in 2012 for the same price he paid for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Rock: The 10 Highest-Grossing Dwayne Johnson Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><h1>$4.5 million</h1><p><a href=#>Johnson</a> has shared that Florida is his favorite place to live. It has been reported that he has&nbsp;had ten homes in the state, with the prices of those homes ranging between $1 million and $3 million, according to <a href=#>Amo Mama</a>.</p><p>This gated Florida townhouse has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two 3 car garages, and a stellar full outdoor kitchen. This spacious townhouse gives off all the rustic and natural vibes while still remaining quaint and cozy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h1>$3.4 million</h1><p>Johnson has had many mansions in Florida throughout the years, but perhaps his favorite is his $3.4 million dollar abode purchased in 2012. This mansion is a whopping 13,000 square feet; equipped with a home theater, <a href=#>swimming pool,</a> jacuzzi, and an office. There is also a rumor that this Florida mansion has its very own barbershop.</p><p>Johnson purchased the mansion from former Miami Dolphin Vernon Carey for $3.4 million in 2012, as reported by <a href=#>Republic World.</a> Just one year of purchasing this luxury home, he sold it just one year later at $3 million dollars. Some of the renovations included a professional at-home gym with a private house just for his trainer. Not a bad investment.</p><p>It has been reported that the Rampage actor has dished out a stunning $100 million of his fortune into property investments. Aside from spending his millions on mansions, The Rock also has a penchant for fast, expensive cars.&nbsp;One of his favorite pricey rides includes a Rolls a Royce Wraith and a Ford pickup truck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you thought that Johnson made his millions just by acting along, think again. He is the co-owner of Seven Bucks Productions with his ex-wife, Dany Garcia. Seven Bucks has preceded several movies and television shows, including Ballers and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.&nbsp;He also has an Under Armor line, dubbed Project Rock, that <a href=#>sells clothing, shoes, and headphones.</a> It is estimated that he earns seven figures annually for his apparel collaboration. If that weren't enough, he is the founder of his very own spirits line--&nbsp;Teremana tequila.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does Johnson spend his hard-earned money on swanky mansions and luxury cars, but he is generous with his wealth, too. In 2016, the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation was founded. This foundation is a charity that works with terminally ill children.</p><p>Aside from his wealth and fame, many have revealed that Johnson is simply a down-to-earth family man. The actor has three children--&nbsp;Simone, Jasmine, and Tiana. In 2019, he married his long-time girlfriend,&nbsp;Lauren Hashian. Johnson shares his eldest daughter Simone with his ex-wife. It doesn't appear that the famous actor is going to slow down anytime soon!&nbsp;Aside from the five films that are in pre-production, you can find him on his HBO series, Ballers.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single><a href=#>NEXT:&nbsp;The Rock: 10 Crazy Expensive Things Dwayne Johnson Has Bought</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmadr5Guu6Z5yaifp6ufo3qutculoKimXZm8rbjAq2SmmZ6otrC6jLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-david-dobrik-became-one-of-the-most-influential-social-media-stars-and-built-his-20-million-emp.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How David Dobrik Became One Of The Most Influential Social Media Stars And Built His $20 Million Emp">&larr;
