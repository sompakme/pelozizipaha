Season two ended in 2020 and production was delayed on season three due to Covid, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Applegate's Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this will be the final season. When this was announced, Christina Applegate tweeted, "I will miss these ladies. But we felt this was the best way to tie up the story of these women. Thank you to all the fans. We will be getting back to work when it is safe to do so. Much love."</p><p>Season three will probably tie up many of the loose ends left from previous seasons. But after such a long wait, we might need a refresher course.</p><p><span class=article-alert>SPOILER ALERT!

Jen is mourning the death of her husband, Ted, who was killed in a hit-and-run while out jogging at night. Judy claims to be mourning the loss of her fiancé Steve. The two connect immediately and become fast friends. They have late night phone calls and the duo even drive around at night looking for cars that may have been in a hit-and-run so that Jen can find out who was responsible for her husband's death.</p><p>But Judy's real story is not what she told Jen. Her fiancé is still very much alive. When Judy finds out, she is so upset at her friend's deception that she cuts off all contact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judy forgives her new friend when she explains her situation. She had a series of miscarriages, which is what she is really mourning, and Steve left her.

She purposely went to the grief group to find Jen because she was the one who hit Ted with her car. She originally found Jen on purpose to tell her the truth, but couldn't do it.</p><p>While living in the guest house, Judy discovers that Jen blames herself for her husband's death because the couple had a fight before he left the house that night. She could not let her friend live with the guilt, so she tells her the truth.</p><p>Jen is furious and throws her out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How ‘Dead To Me’ Star Natalie Morales Directed Her First Movie In The Pandemic</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-steve-wood-on-dead-to-me><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Steve Wood On Dead To Me?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Wood, played by James Marsden, is Judy's ex-fiance</a>.

While there, it comes out that Judy was not alone in the car the night Ted was killed. Steve was in the passenger seat, and he was the one who convinced Judy to drive away and not help the man she just hit. Jen realizes that her friend was manipulated by this man. Jen and Steve argue, and she pulls Ted's gun on him.</p><p>Jen calls Judy before she is able to commit suicide and asks her to come over.
