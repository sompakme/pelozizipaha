Sources at the time had claimed that the pop star wasn’t over his former flame, who he had shared a lengthy on-again, off-again relationship with for well over five years at that point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Needless to say, the Biebs didn’t take the news well, and by February 2017, it was apparent that a feud was bound to erupt between him and The Weeknd after famously telling a photographer in LA that he would never listen to the latter’s music again.</p><p>“Hell no I can’t listen to a Weeknd song. That sh**’s wack,” he responded.</p><p>Bieber’s reaction made it clear he wasn’t happy about Gomez’s romance, but things continued to take a turn for the worse when The Weeknd taunted the Sorry chart-topper with the release of his song Some Way with Toronto rapper Nav.</p><h2 id=the-weeknd-disses-justin-bieber>The Weeknd Disses Justin Bieber</h2><p>On his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">verse</a>, The Weeknd, real name Abel Tesfaye, sings: “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” which was immediately perceived to have been a dig at Bieber, and rightfully so given that the 30-year-old was now seeing Gomez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that wasn’t all because The Weeknd then went on to sing: “She say my f**k and my tongue game a remedy,” which many perceived as an implication that he was better than Bieber when it came to intimacy, leaving fans in an absolute frenzy over the controversial track.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?</a></span></p><p>“Wow, The Weeknd just dissed the heck out of Justin Bieber,” one user wrote on Twitter. “He should’ve never said anything about Abel’s music and just left those two in peace. I highly doubt that’s the end of their public feud.”</p><p>Another social media user echoed similar words, writing: “Honestly didn’t see this Justin and The Weeknd feud over Selena Gomez, but that Some Way song was just disrespectful yet funny at the same time. How can he insult Justin’s bedroom skills like that? Lol.”</p><p>Halfway into 2017 and it was very clear that Bieber and The Weeknd were not on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">good terms</a> with one another - and it was all over the latter’s relationship with Gomez, who, as previously mentioned, the Biebs still shared strong feelings for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the midst of the drama between both artists, it was the former Disney star who then added fuel to the fire by recording her own diss track, titled Bad Girlfriend, which she reportedly penned with JB in mind.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starboy: Interesting Facts About The Weeknd’s Album</a></span></p><p>A source told the news publication that the song was “about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to” while the lyrics included: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.”</p><p>The track didn’t end up seeing a release date and was shelved - presumably because the attention that had already surrounded The Weeknd’s feud with Bieber didn’t need to spiral out of control any further than it already had.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were turning against each other over Bieber’s supposed cold feelings towards the Can’t Feel My Face chart-topper, and though things started off rough between the two for the first half of the year, things quickly died down as neither one of them felt inclined to continue spreading negative comments about each other in the press or in their music.</p><h2 id=the-weeknd-and-selena-s-split>The Weeknd And Selena’s Split</h2><p>By October 2017, however, sources exclusively told People magazine that Gomez and The Weeknd had decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">call it quits</a>, stating that “it’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.”</p><p>“It’s been hard for them to come to the realization that this is the direction things were heading, but it’s been hard for months,” the insider added, insisting that the pair would carry on being close friends, but as far as their relationship was concerned, that had officially become a thing of the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailey Baldwin’s 10 Most Stunning & Wholesome Instagram Pics</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following month, the Lose You To Love Me songstress is spotted out and about in California with none other than the Biebs, who she shared a bike ride with through the streets of sunny Los Angeles.</p><p>It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what was bound to happen next: Gomez and Bieber had officially reconciled and things were very much back on track for the couple, who had taken a break from each other for just over a year before deciding to give their romance another shot.</p><p>During their time together, reports claimed that Gomez’s family was concerned about her getting back with Bieber, who they blamed for sending her to rehab on several occasions, and by May 2018, the relationship had come to an end - but this time, it was for good.</p><p>Just four months later, Bieber would go on to marry his on-off girlfriend Hailey Baldwin in a New York courthouse before holding their traditional ceremony the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Married Hailey Baldwin, But Who Were The Famous Women Before Her?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoa6rpJ67bq7Inpmeql2Wu6V506GcZq%2BVmrivsIyopZydXZuytrDEnWSorpWnerSxy56lmmWXpLqmxo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-probst-strips-down-naked-with-bacon-in-two-and-a-half-men-promo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Probst Strips Down Naked, With Bacon in Two and a Half Men Promo">&larr;
