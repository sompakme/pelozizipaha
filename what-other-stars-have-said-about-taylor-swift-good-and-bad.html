Instead, Swift writes songs that tell the stories of her heartbreaks and her triumphs.</p><p>As you might imagine though, Swift is a “strong opinion” magnet, with a combination of devoted fans and friends, and less-than-impressed exes, divas, or rivals who don’t have much good to say about her.</p><p>Here are 15 celebrities who have good and bad things to say about Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-s-net-worth-is-being-affected-by-his-taylor-swift-romance_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Travis Kelce’s Net Worth Is Being Affected By His Taylor Swift Romance</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift going public meant Kelce's bank account was going to see a major bump.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong>Taylor Swift is gearing up for her newest album, "The Tortured Poets Department" to drop on April 19, 2024, and fans can't wait to see what lyrics she'll sing about ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.</p><h2 id=wendy-williams><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Wendy Williams</span></h2><h3 id=bad-things-to-say-about-taylor-swift>Bad Things To Say About Taylor Swift</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wendy-williams-at-the-40th-anniversary-of-nywift-muse-awards.jpg><ul><li><strong>Today: Not friendly with one another</strong></li></ul><p>Wendy Williams is a former television host and media personality that took Swift bashing to new levels.</p><p>Often Williams would use a less-than-flattering picture of Swift in the background while she said nothing but hateful things about her.

"A woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way — that’s taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist."</p><p>Poehler and Swift were then asked to present at the following Golden Globes.
