He moved to Los Angeles at the age of 19 in order to pursue a career in comedy and after 3 long years of performing stand-up comedy at his stepfather's comedy club, he eventually landed himself a job on a TV drama show called China Beach.</p><p>He has since found success as characters in shows like <a href=#>My Name Is Earl </a>and <a href=#>Prison Break.</a> When he's not working on films or TV shows, he can be found on his podcast called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I Am Rapaport</a> as well as on Instagram and TikTok making topical videos about anything from pop culture to politics to sports. His demeanor is very "New York", passionate and in-your-face with a hint of perfect comedic timing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Mary Kate And Ashley Olsen's Best Movies, Based On Audience Reviews">Mary Kate And Ashley Olsen's Best Movies, Based On Audience Reviews</a></span></p><h2 id=how-michael-rapaport-discovered-his-new-favorite-brand-of-clothing>How Michael Rapaport Discovered His New Favorite Brand Of Clothing</h2><p>In late October of last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he posted a clip of his podcast to his Twitter account</a> with the caption, "NYC is a Fashion Show & after 50 years I finally want in!!! #TheRow #Cashmere A Chic New @iamrapaport is here."</p><p>The clip featured him on his podcast talking about a line of clothing called The Row that he was absolutely crazy about. The "cukoo" thing about this clothing line, however, is that it was owned by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. He then proceeded to describe the clothing in his notoriously colorful language that he's come to be known for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They got some high-end chic sh**" he said. “Classy, low-key... dope.” He then described a moment in passing that he had with a stranger on the streets, both of whom were wearing the same clothing brand and who instantly recognized the design. "It was like some Fight Club sh*t. I was like, ‘You know?’ He was like, ‘I know.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen's Revelations About Hollywood's Dark Underbelly Are Truly Shocking ">Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen's Revelations About Hollywood's Dark Underbelly Are Truly Shocking</a></span></p><h2 id=the-simple-and-classic-mary-kate-and-ashley-style-has-found-admirers-from-all-over-hollywood>The Simple And Classic Mary-Kate And Ashley Style Has Found Admirers From All Over Hollywood</h2><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen created the brand of clothing in 2006 and named it after a street in Central London called Savile Row. It consists mainly of neutral colored, draped fabrics with elongated sleeves, exaggerated collars, and a plethora of turtlenecks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The luxury clothing has been a favorite of celebrities like Jonah Hill and Kanye West, as they are stylistically simple as well as versatile. Oh, and it consists of cashmere. LOTS of cashmere. This is what initially caught Michael Rapaport's eye in the first place, as he's been a fan of cashmere since he was younger.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an article posted by GQ,</a> he was quoted relaying a story about how he's had a cashmere sweater for over a decade.</p><p>“Another thing I’ve always liked is cashmere,” he said. “Cashmere sweaters, cashmere hoodies, cashmere sweatpants. And again, I know this isn’t something that anybody could afford, but my first cashmere sweater, I got 12 years ago, and it’s still in perfect condition because [of] the amount of money I spent on it. It’s never gotten messed up. I treat it well. I respect it. And you know, when it’s not cashmere season, I put it away. I call myself, ‘The King of Cashmere.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Mary-Kate Olsen Is Divorcing Pierre Olivier Sarkozy...

It's one of those fickle things where you either have it, or you don't. And unfortunately for quite a lot of celebrities, they don't have it and cannot, for their lives, seem to find it.</p><p>However, this doesn't seem to be the case for "King of Cashmere" Mr. Michael Rapaport, who can be oftentimes seen in his TikTok and Instagram videos sporting his nigh-trademark cashmere sweaters and looking rather distinguished in them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpZmYtaKxy2apmqiRpbyzwIyapZ1lpJ2ybrvLrJynZaSstq%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./16-celebrities-who-could-not-keep-their-nose-clean.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="16 Celebrities Who Could Not Keep Their Nose Clean">&larr;
