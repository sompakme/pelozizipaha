The model and actor were spotted having the time of their lives at Taylor Swift's concert in Paris, one of the first of the singer's European leg of her Eras tour.</p><p>But they weren't alone. <strong>Travis Kelce also attended that show, as he had promised</strong> a little while before the tour began. He had promised he would accompany Taylor on tour to support her, and that's just what he did. If he got to have a blast listening to great music with his celebrity friends, well, that's just an added bonus.</p><p><strong>A new viral video came out that showed Gigi, Bradley Cooper, and Travis, dancing together to Taylor Swift's hit "Blank Space"</strong>. They were in their private box, and Gigi Hadid looked ecstatic as she waved her arms around, right in between her boyfriend and the Kansas City Chiefs player, who were swaying to the rhythm as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-and-travis-39-romantic-getaway-with-gigi-hadid-and-bradley-cooper>Taylor And Travis' Romantic Getaway With Gigi Hadid And Bradley Cooper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-2-1.jpg><p>That Taylor Swift and Gigi Hadid are good friends is no news, but it was still surprising to learn that they were close enough to go on romantic getaways with their boyfriends together.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">It was Donna Kelce who shared the news</a> that <strong>Taylor and Travis had spent their short vacation in Carmel-by-the-Sea with Gigi and Bradley.</strong> The Kansas City Chiefs star shared a photo with his mother of Taylor Swift and him hanging out with their famous friends, and the mom was very excited about it and had to share the news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-bradley-cooper-and-gigi-hadid.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Joined By Bradley Cooper And Gigi Hadid In Romantic Getaway">Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Joined By Bradley Cooper And Gigi Hadid In Romantic Getaway</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid joined Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce on a couples getaway to the beach.</p><p>During his chat with his mother, Travis informed her that Bradley Cooper would be attending the same QVC event as Donna in Las Vegas.

She went up to him, said hi, and told him "Travis told me you were going to be here."</p><p>This concert in Paris will probably not be the only one Travis Kelce will be attending during the European leg of Taylor Swift's tour, so fans should be on the lookout for more fun moments of the football player hanging out with Taylor's friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieop%2BZYrWisMidZJuqkZm5psWMnKaoqJWneqa%2BwKxkraelp3qzu8yapa2hk2K0psDAsJiyZaSWxq270Warq5mmnsBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./karrion-kross-says-we-may-see-him-involved-in-a-cinematic-match-before-the-end-of-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Karrion Kross Says We May See Him Involved In A Cinematic Match Before The End Of 2020">&larr;
