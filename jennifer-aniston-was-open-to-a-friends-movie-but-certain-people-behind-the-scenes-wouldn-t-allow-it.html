The show started on NBC in the fall of 1994, and would go on for 10 seasons, airing its last episode in early May of 2004. Despite the show ending almost two decades ago, fans are still discussing what the future might've looked like for the characters of the show, and the possibility of more from the sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Courteney Cox's Controversial Friends Commercial Never Made It On The Air And Was Banned By NBC</a></span></p><p>It only makes sense for fans to feel this way, everyone wanted to know what the future might've looked like for Ross and Rachel. The two had undeniable chemistry, and whoever got in their way was in for rough ride. That was the case for guest-star Lauren Tom, <a href=#>who actually got booed during tapings</a> for coming in the way of Ross and Rachel.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at what the plans were like for a possible movie. Although fans seem to think that the cast nixed the plans, that wasn't the case. We'll reveal what Lisa Kudrown and <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> said about a possible film, and why it was rejected by those behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cast-of-friends-shared-their-thoughts-on-what-would-39-ve-happened-to-their-characters>The Cast Of Friends Shared Their Thoughts On What Would've Happened To Their Characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.png><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The cast of Friends made some bold predictions</a> as to what the future might look like. According to Lisa Kudrow, Phoebe would be starting a family with Mike, and they would be doing things a little differently with their family.</p><p>“Phoebe’s married to Mike [Paul Rudd], they’re probably in Connecticut, they have kids, and I think she was the advocate for her kids who were a little different and all the other kids who were just a little different, creating the arts program, the music thing, all that.”</p><p>As for Rachel, she would also be living the family life alongside Ross. Aniston revealed, “You still played with bones,” she added. “That’s paleontology."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Was Spot On With His Pep Talk For Aisha Tyler During Her First Day On Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the others, Monica would be just as intense and competitive, while her children would be overachievers.

However, Aniston would reveal that it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the producers who nixed these plans.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Our producers wouldn’t want it, wouldn’t let us,” she told the publication. “Look, it’s not been without our desire to, because our fans have wanted it so much."</p><p>Speaking alongside James Corden, Lisa Kudrow was also asked about the possible movie or extra episode. Kudrow stated that the creators didn't want to re-up the stories, given how perfect the endings were on the show.</p><p>“That’s all up to [creators] Marta [Kauffman] and David [Crane], and I once heard them say — and I completely agree — that they ended the show very nicely, everyone’s lives are very nice, and they would have to unravel all those good things in order for there to be stories. I don’t want anyone’s happy ending unraveled. Also, at my age, to say ‘floopy,’ stop, you have to grow up.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge Kept To Herself And Stayed In Her Dressing Room During Her 'Intimidating' Experience On Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like fans of the series will get there fix of the show by watching reruns and the countless hours on behind the scenes footage, including the many bloopers from the show's decade long run.</p><h2 id=the-friends-reunion-took-place-but-according-to-courteney-cox-it-will-be-the-last-one-ever>The Friends: Reunion Took Place, But According To Courteney Cox, It Will Be The Last One Ever</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar49489472.jpg><p>The Friends: Reunion was watched by millions of fans. Although it wasn't the episode or film fans were hoping for, it was still great to go back in time and see how it all began and progressed throughout the ten years.</p><p>Some fans were hopeful that this sort of reunion can be an ongoing one every so often. However, Courteney Cox was quick to shut those rumors down, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming that it was a one time ordeal.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Honestly, this will really make me cry, but this will be the last time that we’re ever asked about the show as a group that we will do this," she said. "Like, we’re not going to do this [again] in 15 more years."</p><p>On the bright side, Cox revealed that the cast wouldn't wait as long to have dinner and enjoy time together away from the camera. Most of the cast remains very close and that should not come as a surprise given their great chemistry for many seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bsPArGSoqJWjerW7jJpkn6qZmrulv4ympq%2BhlWKvtsCMrZ%2BeZaCnvKXBwp6prGWnpMKtsM2tZJqknKTEbrXTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./love-island-s-star-gemma-owen-spotted-wearing-her-50-000-ultra-rare-diamond-necklace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Love Islands Star Gemma Owen Spotted Wearing Her $50,000 Ultra-Rare Diamond Necklace">&larr;
