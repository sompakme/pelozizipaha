Fisher will take on the lead role, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with an insider telling In Touch</a> that fans can “expect lots of subtle references to her own life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie, penned by Kimmy Gatewood and Alison Becker, with Gatewood directing, follows the journey of three divorced women seeking revenge on their ex-husbands by attending a family wedding with the most attractive dates they can find. Through comedic narrative, they navigate the complexities of love and redefine their perceptions of divorce.</p><p>For now, Fisher hasn’t commented on the project, though it’s already got fans theorizing that the notoriously private actress may use it as an outlet to share her side of the break-up.</p><p>Following various reports the couple had been leading separate lives for some time, Baron Cohen and Fisher addressed the speculation via their Instagram stories to release a joint statement. “After a long tennis match lasting over twenty years, we are finally putting our racquets down. In 2023 we jointly filed to end our marriage,” it said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We have always prioritized our privacy and have been quietly working through this change,” they continued. “We forever share in our devotion and love for our children.
