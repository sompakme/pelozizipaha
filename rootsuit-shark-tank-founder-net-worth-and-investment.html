It’s just a fad that could easily be replaced by other similar products.”</p><p>Although the sharks did not see the investment opportunity in RootSuit, the pitch on Shark Tank provided valuable exposure for the brand, leading to increased visibility and recognition.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RootSuit-Pitch-on-Shark-Tank-1024x585.jpg alt="RootSuit Pitch on Shark Tank" title="RootSuit Pitch on Shark Tank" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>RootSuit Founder</h2><p>Colin Grussing, a mechanical engineer and athlete, is the visionary behind RootSuit.
