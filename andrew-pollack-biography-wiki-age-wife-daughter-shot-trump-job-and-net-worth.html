His daughter Meadow Pollack who died when she was 18-year-old was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018.</strong><span id=more-156927></span></p><p>Andrew is publicly acknowledged with helping to pass the “Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act” (Florida Senate Bill: 7026). So far he has met with President Donald Trump and his cabinet, Florida governor Rick Scott, and many lawmakers.&nbsp; He is actively fighting to increase more federal funding to increase school security in every school across the nation. Andrew believes that bulletproof glass, metal detectors, enhanced door lock systems, ID checkpoints, and “school marshals” can help prevent school shootings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-job></span>Andrew Pollack Job<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew whose daughter Meadow was killed in the deadly school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School quietly resigned from a state commission formed to investigate the shooting in order to pursue his own probe.</p><p>Andrew among the more outspoken Parkland parents, submitted a resignation letter following the commission’s first meeting in April, announcing that he was leaving. He wrote in the letter dated May 4 and read Thursday morning into the record by commission chairman Sheriff Bob Gualtieri that he wants to focus on the upcoming Broward School Board elections and on an independent investigation in which he’s involved.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollock-age></span>Andrew Pollock Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew was born on February 18, 1966, in Oceanside, New York, <strong>United State</strong>.&nbsp; He is 53 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-family></span>Andrew Pollack Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-wife></span>Andrew Pollack Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He lives in Chabad of Coral Springs with his wife, Dr. Julie Phillips Pollack, an emergency room physician, and their 2-year-old Belgian Malinois, Sonny. The wheels on the 4-by-4 truck that anchors their Eagle Cap camper home are a symbol of Pollack’s every intention to escape Broward County, its “unethical Democrat” politicians and the “sick, demented” people who support them.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-daughter></span>Andrew Pollack Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Andrew’s daughter Meadow Jade Pollack who was born on October 5, 1999, and died on February 14, 2018, was murdered in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.&nbsp; She was shot four times and had attempted to avoid the shooter while struggling to get into a classroom. Teachers and students were not able to open the classroom door. Andrew told CBN that as the shooter returned, her daughter covered another student in an attempt to protect them. She was then shot five more times, killing her and the other student she shielded, Cara Loughran, a freshman.</p><p>Her death prompted her father to found Meadow’s Movement, a movement fighting for increased school security to prevent future school massacres. Meadow planned to attend Lynn University in the fall and spoke about becoming a lawyer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-facts-and-body-measurements></span>Andrew Pollack Facts and Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Andrew Pollack</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 18, 1966</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Oceanside, New York, U.S.</li><li><strong>Birthday:</strong> 18th February.</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Fathers Name:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Mothers Name:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> married</li><li><strong>Children/ Kids: </strong>three children</li><li><strong>Height/ How tall?: </strong>Not available</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>Not available</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-net-worth></span>Andrew Pollack Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew has never revealed his estimated net worth. He raised about $92,000 of the $1 million which he believes the playground will cost to build. &nbsp;Andrew doesn’t want to think of, his only daughter, in the context of a graveyard. Instead, he wants to remember her as a smiling kid with a fulfilling life. So Andrew’s planning the construction of a different kind of memorial: a playground.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-trump></span>Andrew Pollack Trump<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew and his two sons on February 21, 2018, attended a White House listening session hosted by President Donald Trump.&nbsp; It consisted of siblings and friends of slain victims along with survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Andrew spoke extensively on the topic of school security, claiming that schools do not have the same level of security as airports, stadiums, and embassies.</p><p>He raised that the September 11 attacks happened once and that measures were put in place to prevent it from ever happening again, also stating “There should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it!”&nbsp; Andrew launched his nonprofit organization Americans for Children’s Lives and School Safety (CLASS) on April 20, 2018. Governor-elect of Florida&nbsp;Ron DeSantis, a Republican, included both Andrew and Hunter on his Transition Advisory Committee on Public Safety.</p><h2 class=page-headline><span class=ez-toc-section id=daughters-murder-made-andrew-pollack-%e2%80%98pro-second-amendment></span>Daughter’s murder made Andrew Pollack ‘pro-Second Amendment’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew Pollack, known as the outspoken father of one of the students killed during the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, said Wednesday that he was never a big gun-rights supporter until he realized how defenseless his daughter was when she was gunned down at school last year.</p><p>“I was never such a pro-Second Amendment type of guy until this happened to my daughter and I saw how she became such a victim on that third floor and no one came in to help her,” Mr. Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter Meadow was among the 17 students and staff killed by a gunman on Valentine’s Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told Fox News host Martha MacCallum.</p><p>Mr. Pollack cited the recent mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed and others attempted to hide or flee, as an example of people needing to be able to carry guns so they can fight back.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-andrew-pollack></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Andrew Pollack<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-andrew-pollack></span>Who is Andrew Pollack?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Andrew Scot Pollack is an American author and school safety activist who became known to viewers during a CNN interview with Donald Trump to demos d action on less violence after 18-year-old daughter Meadow Pollack was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-andrew-pollack></span>How old is Andrew Pollack?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Andrew is 53 years old as of 2019.
