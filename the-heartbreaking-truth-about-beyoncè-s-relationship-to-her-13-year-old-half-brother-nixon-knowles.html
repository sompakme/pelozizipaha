There's <strong><a href=#>Jay-Z</a></strong>'s <a href=#>cheating drama</a>, which started when the former's sister, <a href=#>Solange attacked the rapper in the elevator</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It went on to inspire the Renaissance artist's sixth studio album, Lemonade (2016) where the singer addressed the infidelity, as well as her <a href=#>complicated relationship with her father and former manager, Mathew Knowles</a> — who also graced the tabloids after Bey's mom Tina Knowles filed for divorce in 2009, upon discovering Mathew had fathered a love child during their marriage.</p><p>Now, the said child, Nixon Knowles has reportedly been asking his mom, Alexsandra Wright why the Grammy record-breaker "doesn't love" him. In 2010, a judge ordered Mathew to pay $12,000 a month in child support to Nixon, just before Beyoncé fired him as her manager. After that, the payment was dropped to $2,485.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the Break My Soul performer's current relationship with her dad and her half-brother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Backup Dancer Saves Beyoncé From An Embarrassing Wardrobe Mishap In The Middle Of A Live Performance</a></span></p><h2 id=did-beyonc-eacute-fire-her-dad-as-manager-because-of-his-love-child-scandal>Did Beyoncé Fire Her Dad As Manager Because Of His Love Child Scandal?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fzrk_mfx0aerhc1.jpeg><p>Following the scandal, Mathew told Us Weekly that he and Tina "mutually agreed to part ways in terms of me managing Beyoncé, as my focus is in the investment of Music World Entertainment's growing gospel and inspirational music division. Because of the success of these artists, my focus has to be on gospel now."</p><p>Beyoncé also clarified that firing his dad as her manager was not a reflection of their personal relationship at that time. "I've only parted ways with my father on a business level," said the Halo singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He is my father for life and I love my dad dearly. I am grateful for everything he has taught me. I grew up watching both he and my mother manage and own their own businesses. They were hard-working entrepreneurs and I will continue to follow in their footsteps."</p><p>TMZ later discovered that the decision came after "Beyoncé had her law firm conduct an audit, and the law firm concluded Mathew had indeed pilfered money from her."</p><p>However, "Mathew insists the theft accusations by Live Nation are false, and he wants the judge to give him the right to take depositions of various people at Live Nation, to determine just how they concluded he was a thief."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Beyonce And Jay-Z Get Special Twitter Privileges Because Of Their Friendship With Co-Founder Jack Dorsey?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-beyonc-eacute-39-s-relationship-with-her-dad-like-today>What's Beyoncé's Relationship With Her Dad Like Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ef4f_5ewsaej5zv.jpeg><p>In 2019, following his breast cancer diagnosis, Mathew said that he and Beyoncé were on good terms. "I have a great relationship as a father with not just Beyoncé," he told Us before promoting <a href=#>Solange's own music career</a>. "But people forget I have this talented, gifted kid named Solange, who is a Grammy winner and has had a number one album. People tend to think she does not exist."</p><p>Mathew has also expressed interest in <a href=#>reuniting Destiny's Child</a> — which he used to manage — for "one last album." Although he said it was "a decision that the ladies would have to make," he told Entertainment Tonight that he "would certainly, certainly support that decision as I still manage Destiny's Child. I would love to see that as well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think the fans will be just overjoyed, overwhelmed," he continued. "And hopefully they do one last time in their career. Hopefully they give us one last album. Who knows? You never know. You never say it can't happen. Because this is entertainment. A lot of things can happen."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Both Beyoncé And Taylor Swift Went On Tour, But Whose Is Bigger?</a></span></p><h2 id=does-beyonc-eacute-have-a-relationship-with-half-brother-nixon-knowles>Does Beyoncé Have A Relationship With Half-Brother Nixon Knowles?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-2023-07-15-at-11-14-26-am.png><p>Recently, Alexsandra opened up about his son, Nixon, asking her: "Why doesn't that person [Beyoncé] love me?" The businesswoman added that she cries to the pop star's song, Ring Off, which she believes to relate to Mathew dating her then splitting with Tina. "If you listen to Ring Off, it's the story," said Alexsandra.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's not for me but I know the timing. I was inside," she continued. "And when I listen to it, I have goosebumps and tears. It makes me cry for them because everyone is in pain and there has been so much sadness." She then confirmed that Beyoncé doesn't have any relationship with Nixon.</p><p>"She is a billionaire and just bought the most expensive house in California, ten miles from where we live," Alexsandra said of his son not seeing his half-sister. "But no, there has not been any contact. The pain still needs to heal. My main concern has been dealing with a child that asks, 'Why doesn’t that person love me?.'"</p><p>She went on to admit that it's all taken an emotional toll on her. "It's a very human story and I sit in the bathroom and cry sometimes because I just don't know how to help him be his own person," Alexsandra shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But I believe our children and grandchildren will be much better human beings than we are. They have Snapchat and all that. I think they will find a way to open up and have that conversation."</p><p>Beyoncé has never publicly talked about her half-siblings, including 13-year-old Koi Knowles whose mother is TaQoya Branscomb. In 2014, TaQoya also said that the Obsessed star hadn't met her daughter yet. "They are half sisters and maybe one day down the line that can be made possible," she told Insider Edition at that time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnrGfo7CmedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSdnaSWtq2%2FjK2mZqCRobNurtGoq6GdomK7qsTOp2Skpp%2Bsuaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-does-bundle-listing-mean-on-ebay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What does bundle listing mean on ebay">&larr;
