It is even harder to believe that Lorne Michaels wanted to take a different approach with Donald and his appearance on the show. As we'll reveal in the following, a former cast member stated Michaels wanted a positive approach to Trump, unlike what the media was selling at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll take a closer look at what went on prior to his cameo, along with also unveiling the troubled history between the two sides in recent years. Trump took a shot at the show's quality and ratings, while SNL hasn't steered away from Trump content, especially during his Presidential run. We're going to reveal where the two sides stand, and how the SNL cast reacted to changes implemented by Lorne Michaels prior to Donald's cameo.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Stephen Colbert Apologized To Donald Trump During Their Rare Interview, But The Host Clearly Wasn't Taking Him Seriously</a></span></p><h2 id=donald-trump-has-taken-shots-at-snl-in-the-recent-years>Donald Trump Has Taken Shots At SNL In The Recent Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donald-trump-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former President got to host SNL during the 2010s and according to his own assessment, the ratings for the episode skyrocketed. However, Trump feels as though in the years that followed, the show started to slide down, especially in terms of quality.</p><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump took to Truth Social</a>, voicing his opinion on the series and where it is at today.</p><p>"I once hosted Saturday Night Live, and the ratings were HUUUGE! Now, however, the ratings are lower than ever before, and the show will probably be put to “rest.” It is just not, at these levels, sustainable - A bad show that’s not funny or smart. L.M. is angry and exhausted, the show even more so. It was once good, never great, but now, like the Late Night Losers who have lost their audience but have no idea why, it is over for SNL - A great thing for America!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Mick Jagger Banned A Joke Written By John Mulaney For His SNL Monologue</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trump was also critical of the show during his Presidential run after Alec Baldwin took part in a skit poking fun at the President. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald once again took to Twitter</a>, ripping on the show for its fake news.</p><p>"Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion," he wrote in the 2019 tweet.</p><p>It seems like things were headed towards a different trajectory back in 2015. In fact, former SNL cast members claim Lorne Michaels did his best to make Trump appear as 'likable'.</p><h2 id=lorne-michaels-was-very-specific-on-what-could-be-said-about-donald-trump-and-tried-to-make-him-39-likable-39>Lorne Michaels Was Very Specific On What Could Be Said About Donald Trump, And Tried To Make Him 'Likable'</h2><p>Former SNL cast member Taran Killam made quite the reveal alongside Deadline. A few years prior to the Alec Baldwin skit, Lorne Michaels wanted to take a different approach, attempting to take a different approach with Donald Trump. Given the approach, Lorne put several rules in place with the writing team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Killam reveals, “Lorne was being so specific about what we could and couldn’t say about [Trump], and he was dictating a lot of the settings.”</p><p>Lorne Michaels felt as though knocking on Trump wasn't unique given everyone was doing it at the time.</p><p>“Lorne was like, ‘It’ll be too old news by then, and you know, you don’t want to vilify him. He’s like any New York taxi driver. I know him, I’ve seen him around at parties for years and years, and he just says whatever it is he’s thinking. And that’s his thing. But you have to find a way in that makes him likable.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>After David Spade Made This Joke On 'Saturday Night Live', Eddie Murphy Was Furious With Him For Years</a></span></p><p>As expected, the treatment of Trump wasn't met positively by the res of the cast.</p><h2 id=the-cast-of-snl-was-not-pleased-with-the-rules-and-donald-trump-39-s-appearance-back-in-2015>The Cast Of SNL Was Not Pleased With The Rules, And Donald Trump's Appearance Back In 2015</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar50971492.jpg><p>Killam would go on to admit that the cast was very confused as to why they needed to be sensitive around Donald Trump topics. Though everyone got some clarity once it was revealed that Donald was supposed to host the show in the upcoming weeks.</p><p>“I was like, what is happening? What? Everybody that I know and respect was, like, this guy [Trump] is a bad dude, this guy is a buffoon.” When he soon saw Trump’s name on the board for upcoming guest hosts, “It was like, Oh, ok, that’s why. I see.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for other former cast members like Anthony Jeselnik, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the comedian admitted the idea to help Trump out was 'revolting'.</a></p><p>“I was disgusted by it,” Jeselnik revealed during the Last Laugh podcast. “It was two rich guys helping each other out. I don’t know how I would have dealt with it if I was on the show. I found it to be, quite frankly, revolting.”</p><p>Certainly a rocky history between Trump and SNL, filled with tension in recent years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqKqemnqutcKhmJ6ko2Kws7HArZydZaKquaa%2FjJqpqK2emXq4tMCtZJynpaGxbq7EZqqaoZRirqO71K1knaeelrmledOrrKaoXaS7br%2FNpWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rick-shiels-is-married-to-wife-claire-shiels.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rick Shiels is Married to Wife: Claire Shiels">&larr;
