Barbie is to be released on July 21st too!</p><h2 id=john-wick-chapter-4-is-a-movie-fans-have-been-waiting-years-for><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Wick: Chapter 4 Is A Movie Fans Have Been Waiting Years For</span></h2><p>The hype is REAL around the fourth installment in the John Wick franchise.
