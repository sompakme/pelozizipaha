She most recently played a power-hungry mayor named Michelle Cross on the campy horror show Chucky. And her daughters Alyssa Alyn Lind, Emily Alyn Lind, and Natalie Alyn Lind are also super successful actors who keep racking up movie and TV credits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Alyn Lind sisters are really close</a>, which is nice to hear about since they are all working hard in the same industry. Whenever children of famous actors or singers follow what their parents are doing, it can be hard to know if they really have a passion for this field. Or do they feel like they have to do the same thing as their family? It's interesting to find out whether Barbara Alyn Woods wanted her kids to be actors or if they came to this decision on their own.</p><h2 id=did-barbara-alyn-woods-encourage-daughters-emily-alyn-lynd-and-natalie-alyn-lind-to-act>Did Barbara Alyn Woods Encourage Daughters Emily Alyn Lynd And Natalie Alyn Lind To Act?</h2><p>It turns out that Barbara Alyn Woods and her husband John Lind weren't certain that Alyssa Alyn Lind would start acting. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyssa Alyn Lind talked about her childhood</a> in an interview with Soap Opera Digest. She shared that her parents were dealing with Emily and Natalie's acting schedules.

It sounds like she had a great time filming and was also <a href=#>close with the Gossip Girl reboot cast</a>. But she got her start in the business when she was much younger. And that was all thanks to her mom.</p><p>When talking to Smashing Interviews in 2011 when she was nine years old, Emily Alyn Lind shared why she wanted to become an actress. When asked if she "caught the acting bug" because of Barbara Alyn Woods, Emily agreed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/emily-alyn-lind.jpg><p>Emily said, "Yes, that’s really how I started. I would go on set with my mom and watch her do her thing and think, “Oh, I want to do that so much.” So I just started doing it and it has been an ongoing thing for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emily shared with Smashing Interviews that she got her first acting job at four. She said that her mom would help her run lines: "She’s my acting coach. She reads scripts with me and goes over them with me."</p><p>Emily Alyn Lind played Young Lily in the 2008 movie The Secret Life of Bees and had small roles on TV shows like Flashpoint, All My Children, Days of Our Lives, and Medium.

They actually met on a film lot. I was literally raised on a set. Since I was little, I’ve always had a passion for acting and art. Watching my mom transform into different characters inspired me at a very young age.

Alyssa was one-year-old at the time. The agent wanted to begin working with Alyssa. And it seemed like a natural fit for Barbara Alyn Woods's youngest daughter, who loved saying lines of dialogue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Natalie Alyn Lind Actually Dating Her Sister's Ex-Boyfriend, Kai Caster?</a></span></p><p>In 2011, Alyssa Alyn Lind played Faith Newman on The Young and the Restless, and her career took off.

Barbara and Alyssa Alyn Lind starred on the TV series Chucky together and played a mother and daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chucky-barbara-alyn-woods-alyssa-alyn-lind.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Barbara played the mayor Michelle Cross, Alyssa portrayed Lexy Cross.

She said of Alyssa Alyn Lind, "to be on set with her and for her to be my scene partner was absolutely amazing. And now I know more than ever how talented she is.
