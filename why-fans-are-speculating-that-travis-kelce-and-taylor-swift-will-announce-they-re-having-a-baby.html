Ever since the couple first made their public debut and <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift </a></strong>started attending NFL games, fans and media alike have been <a href=#>buzzing nonstop with news about the couple</a>. Despite any criticism they have faced, including <a href=#>NFL fans saying Swift is bad luck</a>, the couple has remained strong.</p><p>And, if there is any truth to the childhood song many of us grew up singing... "First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage," with engagement rumors in full swing,<a href=#> a baby announcement might not be that far away for Traylor.</a> In the following, we look at why fans are saying Taylor Swift's pregnancy may happen in 2024 and whether or not the pop star wants kids. We also look at what's going on with those Taylor Swift and <strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce </a></strong>engagement rumors and how quickly their relationship has progressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-teeth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's smile might have been helped out with veneers, but there's another reason fans are concerned about her teeth.</span><h2 id=why-taylor-swift-39-s-golden-globe-appearance-sparked-pregnancy-rumors>Why Taylor Swift's Golden Globe Appearance Sparked Pregnancy Rumors</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Swifties may need to "calm down" with hopes of a Taylor Swift pregnancy, because the "Cruel Summer" singer's appearance at the 81st Golden Globes on January 7, 2024 gained attention and not entirely in the nicest way.

Let the woman live," and "No because this is incredibly rude. Leave her alone."
