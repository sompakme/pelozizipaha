We'll take a look at how money he lost along the way and how he's doing these days.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-xzibit-39-s-net-worth>What Happened To Xzibit's Net Worth?</h2><p>Yes, he has a rap career but when we think of Xzibit, his journey on 'Pimp My Ride' instantly comes to mind. Sure, the MTV show has a polarizing legacy, given its legitimacy, however, there is no doubting is success, lasting three years and six seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, MTV pulled the plug on the show as according to Hot Cars,<a href=#>low ratings and a change in the economy played a huge role in its abrupt demise</a>. Rumors have floated around about a possible reboot, however, nothing has been confirmed, nor does it seem that the show will be reemerging any time soon.</p><ul><li><strong>Contestants on 'Pimp My Ride' had a few complaints about the show, which included how long their car was gone for, along with not being able to comment on what mods were done to their car.</strong></li></ul><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>MTV's 'The Challenge': Which Contestants Are Actually Friends In Real Life?</a></span></p><p>Saying goodbye to the show was not only hard for fans, but it was also a tough loss for Xzibit, who relied on the show heavily, especially financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once it was taken off the air, it seems like the host went completely MIA and in addition, his financial situation took a huge hit as he was forced into filing for bankruptcy on multiple occasions.</p><h2 id=xzibit-was-forced-into-filling-for-bankruptcy-on-multiple-occasion>Xzibit Was Forced Into Filling For Bankruptcy On Multiple Occasion</h2><p><a href=#>Xzibit's financial status took a major hit after 'Pimp My Ride'</a> went off the air. It was reported that the host was making $497,175 during his time on the MTV show. A year later after the cancellation, his salary plummeted down to $67,510, which in truth is still a good salary, but nothing compared to what he was making prior.</p><p>The rapper was in a tough spot, owing $959,523 in federal taxes. He declared bankruptcy on two occasions, while foreclosing his Woodland Hills, California home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Happened To Lauren And Derek, The Real Couple On MTV’s ‘Catfish’?</a></span></p><p>He would also list his other home in New Mexico, which would aid in the payment of his amounts owed. His net worth went from in the millions, likely in the $4 million to $5 million range, all the way down to nothing - especially given his lavished lifestyle during his hosting days on 'Pimp My Ride'.</p><p>Although things got derailed, the rapper did not give up and go away. He appeared on the TV series Empire for 38 episodes, along with making a contribution to his rap career, something that appears to be ongoing. Due to his work ethic, the former host appears to be back on his feet financially.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-xzibit-worth-now>How Much Is Xzibit Worth Now?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, according to Celebrity Net Worth, it is believed that Xzibit's net worth is back in the millions, at a cool $2 million.</p><ul><li><strong>Xzibit still posts regularly to his Instagram account, one that has over 1.5 million followers.</strong></li></ul><p>His rap career played a big part, and he would reveal alongside Hip Hop 24x7 that he stayed productive during the pandemic, despite not touring.</p><p>"It’s been hard on a lot of different demographics of people. But, speaking personally, it’s just limited my movements, you know? I’m at my warehouse, I’m at my studio, or I’m at home– one of those three places. My bubble is still intact, but seeing people in disarray and people going through economic hard times– it’s rough on everyone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Once we start touring again, I think it’s gonna be really special for everybody that goes to the first few concerts, and hopefully, the people out there can come to some of our performances cause we plan on getting back out there as soon as it’s right. As soon as it’s open and doing what we do best."</p><p>Xzibit was also spotted working out of Dr. Dre's studio, with fans speculating that a colab might be in the works. The 'Pimp my Ride' star briefly discussed the matter, "When you see me in the studio with Dre, we working on stuff for myself, we working on stuff for him, we working on stuff for everything. But as far as when he releases, that’s up to him. But he never disappoints."</p><p>Props to Xzibit for getting the train back on the tracks, despite the struggle.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>What Happened To Matty From MTV's 'Awkward'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGivs6GSnsFuusStZLCnoqm1bq3FrZyrZaCeurF5zLJkq6GUmnqou9Nmmpqmk5q5rbHDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./leiah-christina-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leiah Christina Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr;
