Not everyone is able to deal with the pressure of being in the entertainment industry and meet the demands that the industry forces upon them. It can be tiring, stressful, and sometimes, hard to deal with. However, some people are able to keep a good head on their shoulders and deal with whatever comes their way. In Hollywood, some people have what it takes to have a long career, while others fall to the child star curse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a young Hollywood star often means that your childhood was far from normal.

For some, dealing with this aspect of fame is hard to deal with, leading them to make life choices that can ruin them. They act in certain ways that are more damaging to themselves and can be the reason why their name is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Other Hollywood stars chose to keep themselves busy and focus on what really matters in life to steer them in the right direction.
