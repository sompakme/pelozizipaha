According to what Selleck wrote in his book, he was put in an awkward position after being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>asked to save Princess Diana from scandal</strong></a>.</p><p>In Selleck's book, he wrote about when he danced with Princess Diana at a 1985 White House dinner. According to Selleck, someone involved with <strong>Princess Diana's team pressured him to dance with the gorgeous royal</strong>.</p><p>According to Selleck, he and Clint Eastwood stood in the corner of the room in the White House where the dinner and a reception that followed were held. At the same time, Princess Diana and John Travolta were dancing. Suddenly, a woman from Princess Diana's team approached Selleck and asked him to cut in on the dancing duo before they could "start rumors".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tom-selleck-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Selleck didn't spell it out in his book, the worry was that Princess Diana and Travolta's dancing could spawn rumors that they were having an affair. According to Selleck, he initially didn't respond to the request to split up Travolta and Princess Diana.</p><p>According to Vogue, Princess Diana had an affair the year after she notably danced with John Travolta at the White House. Amid Princess Diana and Prince Charles' unhappy marriage, she reportedly had an affair with Army Captain James Hewitt from 1986 until 1990.</p><p>In response, the member of Princess Diana's team became more insistent that Travolta had to be stopped.

Everybody else stopped dancing and formed a circle around them, clapping their hands."</p><p>Keep in mind, Travolta and Princess Diana commanded a room that had many world leaders in it, including President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy Reagan.
