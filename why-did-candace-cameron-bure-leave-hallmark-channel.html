Through syndication and streaming, generations of kids have loved the show.</p><p>Candace Cameron Bure is a childhood actor success story. She was able to transition almost seamlessly from DJ Tanner to working adult actor. She even took a turn as a daytime talk show host.

Candace Cameron Bure was just 18 years old. That same year, she met her husband, NHL hockey player Valeri Bure. They were introduced by Candace's co-star Dave Coulier. The couple married two years later, when she was 20 years old.</p><p>When their three children were born, Candace took a self-imposed hiatus from acting. She spent 10 years raising her children and spending time with her new family.</p><p>In 2008, she came back, she says, "with a vengeance" in the Hallmark movie, Moonlight & Mistletoe.</p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-39-s-relationship-with-the-hallmark-channel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure's Relationship With The Hallmark Channel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It began with Moonlight and Mistletoe, but she soon became the "<a href=#>Queen of the Hallmark Channel</a>". She has starred in 29 films for the network. Many of these were Christmas movies. She also starred as mystery solver Aurora Teagarden in the series The Aurora Teagarden Mysteries.</p><p>In 2021, Cameron-Bure only starred in one Christmas movie for the network, which some found unusual.</p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-39-s-other-projects-over-the-years><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure's Other Projects Over The Years</span></h2><p>Being the Queen of Hallmark is not the only thing the Full House alum has worked on.</p><p>Candace Cameron Bure was seated with the ladies of The View for a short time. She told Sarah Haines and Raven Simone on their podcast, Behind the Table, that it was a stressful time for her, "The stress and the anxiety — I actually have a pit in my stomach right now. There was only one type of stress that I've ever felt in my life, that came from that show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But she added, "There were so many wonderful takeaways from the show that as difficult as that job was, I'm very grateful for it. My confidence really grew from doing that show… I don't regret anything, I wouldn't take anything back."</p><p>Bure also reprized her role as DJ Tanner in Fuller House, the sequel to Full House. <a href=#>The series ran for five seasons.</a> It received mixed reviews, but fans loved seeing their favorite characters again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Bob Saget Once Said That Starring In Full House “Tainted” Him</a></span></p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-leaves-hallmark-channel><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure Leaves Hallmark Channel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April, Cameron-Bure announced that she will be leaving Hallmark, "I'm very excited to develop heartwarming family and faith-filled programming and make the kind of stories my family and I love to watch," Bure said in a statement about the move. "I am constantly looking for ways that I can inspire people to live life with purpose. GAC fits my brand perfectly; we share a vision of creating compelling wholesome content for an audience who wants to watch programming for and with the whole family. Great, quality entertainment with a positive message is what my partnership with GAC is all about!"</p><p>She recently said, in an interview published in Variety, “The truth is, I’ve been under contract with Hallmark for a very, very long time. And those [years] have been absolutely wonderful.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> It just so happened that my contract was expiring when Great American Family started up</a>,” she said. “So we did not start having those discussions until we were well into negotiations with Hallmark Channel for renewing. And as every business person knows, you’ve got to do what’s right for contracts. It didn’t work out with Hallmark and so we started talking to Bill [Abbott].”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-great-american-family-channels><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Is Great American Family Channels?</span></h2><p>Great American Family Channels is a cable television network launched in 1995 as Great American Country. It was relaunched in September 2021 as GAC Family Channels. It was changed to a family-oriented channel, similar to Hallmark.</p><p>Bill Abbott, former CEO of Crown Media (which owns Hallmark) and Hicks Equity partners acquired GAC. Some former Hallmark stars have already made the move to GAC, such as Danica McKeller and Lori Loughlin.</p><p>GAC is presently airing nightly reruns of Fuller House.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Michael Rapaport And The Olsen Twins</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-cameron-bure-move-to-gac><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Did Cameron-Bure Move To GAC?</span></h2><p>Candace Cameron Bure will not only act and produce for GAC, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has also been given an executive position</a>. GAC is said to be a network of "faith and family" and they are less likely to show non-Christian or gay characters. Candace did say that faith was a reason she made the move to the network.</p><p>But Hallmark is a very successful network, so some wonder why she is moving away from them. One reason may be Bill Abbott, who may want to show the type of programming that Bure prefers.</p><p>There are other Hallmark stars that will not move to GAC because it may be non-inclusive.</p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-and-her-faith><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure And Her Faith</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Candace has always been vocal about her faith. Her older brother, Kirk Cameron, was also a child star and became an evangelist. He introduced her to religion that resonated with her.</p><p>“My faith is really the foundation of who I am,” she said. “It’s so important to me, and it’s always a part of me, whether it’s at home and privately, or when I’m reading the Bible in Bible study. But also at work, and the choices I make within work, and the companies I choose to work with and the projects that I choose to take on.”</p><p>She encourages her fans to read the bible. She released her One Step Closer Devotional Bible. She says it is easier to read than most bibles.</p><p>Her faith appears to be a big factor in her move to GAC.</p><h2 id=what-is-candace-39-s-first-project-with-gac><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Candace's First Project With GAC?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Candace Cameron Bure has introduced her first film with Great American Family Channel. The movie, entitled AChristmas...Present will premier in November as part of the networks "Great American Christmas" lineup.</p><p>“A Christmas … Present is about slowing down enough to recognize what’s right in front of our eyes,” the former Hallmark Channel star said in a statement announcing the movie.
