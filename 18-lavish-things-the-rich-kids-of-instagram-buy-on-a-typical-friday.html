For a lot of people&nbsp;in this age bracket, a normal day would be waking up early in the morning, going to school or if lucky enough to finish studies early, going to work, spending a couple of hours learning or working, trying to get home through traffic, laying on the bed exhausted, and calling it a day.</p><p>However, not all people have this normal lifestyle. The rich kids of Instagram actually exist and they flaunt their lavish splurges and luxurious lifestyles on social media. Lucky them, they get to spend their fortune in every lavish way possible on normal days!</p><p>These rich kids have this outrageous spending habit that is unstoppable because they simply can afford a very luxurious living. Who are these kids? They can be sons and daughters of the world's most elite class, celebrities and TV personalities, or entrepreneurs. The point is they are all millionaires and billionaires who spend their fortunes just to satisfy their wants and expensive desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, spending great amounts of money for their wardrobe collection, cars, jewelry, first-class plane travels, and vacations should be paraded&nbsp;in front of the public. One of the most brilliant and posh ways to parade this is on Instagram&nbsp;because a lot of Instagrammers have&nbsp;an extreme fascination&nbsp;with expensive things. There was even an account named "Rich Kids of Instagram" that&nbsp;posted every luxurious way a rich kid can spend their money (or their parents' money).</p><p>Better yet, there was even a TV shows entitled "Rich Kids of Instagram" that aired on the British network Channel 4, but the rich kids that were featured are not alone. In fact, there are a lot of elite and rich kids on Instagram that share how they spend their daily lives with their favorite cars and expensive collections. Below are the rich kids who will make you drop your jaw because of their excessive expenditures! Find out who spent $34,000 just for one plane ticket!</p><h2 id=jack-watkin-s-2-4-million-car-collection>Jack Watkin's $2.4 Million Car Collection</h2><p>Let us start this list with Jack Watkin, the son of a wealthy businessman and the self-proclaimed "British Kardashian". Yes, when people claim that they are living the same way the Kardashians are living their lives, that means that they are wealthy and like to brag about their lavish lifestyle on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back when&nbsp;Jack was still a 17-year-old teen, he already had a collection of luxurious cars because his parents love him so much (and spoiled him so much)! Just months after Jack passed his driving test, he already owns a $2.4 million car collection – two Bentleys, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, and Range Rover.</p><p>Because cars are not the only expensive things in the world, Jack also reportedly splurged on a $712,000 Bvlgari watch, which roughly cost around $708,000. Aside from that, he is also swimming in a pool of expensive designer clothes, bags, and shoes!</p><h2 id=daria-radionova-s-swarovski-crystals>Daria Radionova's Swarovski Crystals<strong></strong></h2><p>If the luxurious cars did not send an exciting vibe to your nerves, maybe Daria Radionova's car will definitely give you, not just an exciting vibe, but a glimmering vibe. Daria is another Instagrammer who is famous&nbsp;and claims that she can be the next Kardashian sister, but she resides in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the record, her family background is still a little bit shady, but who cares? Let's focus on the fact that she has&nbsp;a Mercedes Benz that is covered in Swarovski crystals. Daria said that she spent $71,000 on her car, $28,000 on the Swarovski crystals, and $21,000 for her "Russian team" that assembled the crystals on her car. So, how much is that in dollars? Do the math!</p><h2 id=alexandra-dmitrieva-s-birthday-party-at-the-ritz>Alexandra Dmitrieva's Birthday Party At The Ritz</h2><p>When it comes to bragging about wealth and a luxurious lifestyle, Alexandra Dmitrieva can be the next winner! She is an elite daughter of a Russian business tycoon making a fortune from the Russian oil industry. Because she is a rich kid with a very rich dad, Alexandra celebrated her 24th birthday at The Ritz. Although the total amount of how much was spent during that elaborate birthday party was not divulged, you can assume that this would cost a fortune. After all, its The Ritz!</p><p>Do not forget how she brags about her money on Instagram. Alexandra posted a picture of her holding hundreds of thousands of dollars during her trip to a Las Vegas casino. She is not a rich kid and a trendy young woman without a pile of designer bags, clothes, and shoes. So yes, she has a collection of those, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicky-kaufman-s-2-000-bottle-of-champagne>Nicky Kaufman's $2,000 Bottle Of Champagne</h2><p>Meet Nicky Kaufman, a champagne lover!

He loves champagne, not just the ordinary ones but the expensive ones, so much so that he bought a 15 Liter Veuve Clicquot Champagne for almost $2,000 when he had this trip to the Sin City, Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>That is not all! When he had a trip to the Bahamas, he made sure that he will not forget his eight bottles of champagne and his favorite Fendi bag, which can cost thousands of dollars (because it is Fendi!).</p><p>Aside from his passion and love for champagne, Nicky also loves&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;jewelry.&nbsp;Let us not forget his extreme fascination with fur coats!</p><h2 id=clarisse-lafleur-s-designer-clothes>Clarisse Lafleur's Designer Clothes</h2><p>Do you know Clarisse Lafleur?

So, she&nbsp;uses her cards for her shopping spree&nbsp;and even&nbsp;ended up having a bill of $488,685 in just one shopping trip. Oh, and remember, she never regretted it!</p><h2 id=neymar-s-18-000-worth-of-sneakers>Neymar's $18,000 Worth Of Sneakers</h2><p>Sorry Bella Hadid, but you were not able to break Neymar's record in Complex's Sneaker Shopping series because you only spent $1,157.54.
