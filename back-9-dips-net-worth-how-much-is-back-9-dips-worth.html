Hailing from Tampa, Florida, they embarked on their entrepreneurial journey after David was laid off from his job as a golf equipment salesperson.</p><p>Undeterred by the setback, the couple decided to turn their love for barbeque into a business venture and started Back 9 Catering, a barbeque catering service. It was during this time that they discovered their signature item, Chicken Dips, which quickly gained popularity among their customers.</p><p>Recognizing the immense potential of their flavorful creation, David and Nique made the pivotal decision to package and sell their Chicken Dips, thus laying the foundation for Back 9 Dips. With their passion for great food and a commitment to quality, they transformed their catering success into a thriving brand.</p><p>Their innovative approach to dips and their dedication to using quality ingredients set Back 9 Dips apart from the competition, creating a unique flavor experience that resonated with customers.</p><p>“Our mission was to create a dip that showcased the bold and delicious flavors of chicken wings,” says David Mealey, co-founder of Back 9 Dips. “We wanted to bring the taste of a tailgate party to every gathering and have our customers enjoy the experience in every bite.”</p><p>“We started with a simple idea and a lot of hard work. It’s amazing to see how far we’ve come since those early days,” adds Nique Mealey, co-founder of Back 9 Dips.</p><p>Driven by their passion and dedication, David and Nique Mealey took a leap of faith, turning their culinary dreams into reality. Little did they know that their flavorful invention would go on to captivate taste buds across the nation.</p><h2>Back 9 Dips on Shark Tank</h2><p>Back 9 Dips had an opportunity to showcase their unique product on Season 4 of Shark Tank. With a pitch that captivated the sharks, David and Nique Mealey sought a $150,000 investment in exchange for a 15% stake in their company. The back 9 dips pitch showcased their delicious blended chicken wing dips that had gained popularity.</p><p>Raising the stakes, Robert Herjavec and Lori Greiner were quick to recognize the potential of Back 9 Dips and made a deal. They agreed to invest $150,000, but with one condition – 25% equity in the company. This revised back 9 dips Shark Tank deal reflected the sharks’ confidence in the product and its potential for success.</p><p>However, despite the positive outcome on the show, Back 9 Dips faced challenges in the aftermath. The back 9 dips Shark Tank deal had to undergo redesigning, and unfortunately, the company ultimately went out of business.</p><p>The sharks saw promise in Back 9 Dips and recognized its unique flavor and market potential. It was a bittersweet journey for David and Nique Mealey, as the back 9 dips pitch on Shark Tank provided an initial boost but couldn’t secure a lasting success.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/zacjohnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/back-9-dips-shark-tank-1024x585.jpg alt="back 9 dips shark tank" title="back 9 dips shark tank" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Back 9 Dips Shark Tank Summary</h3><table><tr><th>Season</th><th>Episode</th><th>Investor</th><th>Deal</th></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>X</td><td>Robert Herjavec</td><td>$150,000 for 25% equity (revised)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>X</td><td>Lori Greiner</td><td>$150,000 for 25% equity (revised)</td></tr></table><h2>Back 9 Dips Net Worth Timeline</h2><p>Back 9 Dips, the popular dip made from blended chicken wings, entered the entrepreneurial scene with a valuation of $1 million during their appearance on Shark Tank.

The USDA recalled over 12,000 pounds of the dips due to the inclusion of anchovies, an undeclared allergen. This setback led to the company’s collapse and their inability to recover.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/zacjohnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/back-9-dips-recall-1024x585.jpg alt="back 9 dips recall" title="back 9 dips recall" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The recall of Back 9 Dips’ products in 2014 was a significant blow to the business. The inclusion of undeclared allergens, such as anchovies, led to a recall by the USDA, impacting over 12,000 pounds of their dips. This issue not only tarnished the company’s reputation but also resulted in financial losses and legal implications.</p><p>The recall had a cascading effect on Back 9 Dips’ operations, causing a loss of consumer trust and confidence. Customers became wary of purchasing their products, leading to a decline in sales and revenue. Additionally, the recall expenses and potential lawsuits further strained the company’s financial situation, contributing to their ultimate collapse.</p><p>Despite their efforts to rectify the situation, the recall had long-lasting consequences for Back 9 Dips. The negative publicity and damage to their brand image proved too difficult to overcome, ultimately resulting in the closure of the business.</p><p>The example below provides an overview of the recall and its impact on Back 9 Dips:</p><table><tr><th>Recall Details</th><th>Impact on Back 9 Dips</th></tr><tr><td>Recalled over 12,000 pounds of dips</td><td>Loss of inventory and product revenue</td></tr><tr><td>Inclusion of undeclared allergen (anchovies)</td><td>Damaged reputation and loss of consumer trust</td></tr><tr><td>Expenses incurred for recall implementation</td><td>Financial strain and increased liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Potential lawsuits</td><td>Legal implications and additional financial burden</td></tr></table><p>The recall of Back 9 Dips’ products was a significant contributing factor to the collapse of their business. The company’s inability to recover from the negative impact of the recall and regain consumer trust ultimately led to their downfall.</p><h2>Competitors of Back 9 Dips</h2><p>While Back 9 Dips had a unique product with their blended chicken wing dips, they faced competition from other food-related start-ups in the Tampa Bay area.
