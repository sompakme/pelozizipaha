Fans of both stars loved the tribute, most of them saying it was incredibly romantic, and this isn't the first time the pair have shared romantic messages on social media.One of the most memorable exchanges between Paulson and Taylor was <a href=#>Holland Taylor's adorable tweet</a>, where she shared a picture of Sarah Paulson with the caption "no one more beautiful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Paulson's tribute to her partner of seven years had the internet gushing once more, unable to handle how beautifully written the caption to one of Paulson's Instagram posts was.</p><p>"The love of my life @hollandvtaylor is closing her show tonight. I have loved her for 7 years and counting… and tonight, as she brings this production in for its landing, I have never loved her more," Paulson wrote.</p><p>"She is an artist to the marrow… I happen to love a genius. That’s really the truth. The creative achievement of her life thus far was about a woman in pursuit of simple fairness… fundamental goodness, with grit for days. To be inspired by the artistry of the person you share your life with, is the most glorious thing in this world. I love you, I admire you, I worship you @hollandvtaylor"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-sarah-paulson-meet-holland-taylor>How Did Sarah Paulson Meet Holland Taylor?</h2><p>Holland Taylor is an Emmy-Award-winning actress, her most <a href=#>memorable role being in Two and a Half Men</a>, where she played Charlie and Alan Harper's mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Sarah Paulson Really Feel About 'American Horror Story'?</a></span></p><p>Sarah Paulson is an actress who like Holland, has been in several movies and TV shows, but Paulson's most memorable role is American Horror Story. She also plays Mildred in Ratched, and<a href=#> fans are wondering what happened to the second season</a>, which appears to be delayed.</p><p>The truth about the couple is that they met over a decade before they started dating, at a dinner party.

Paulson has also spoken about the age gap she has with Holland.</p><p>“I think there’s a greater appreciation of time and what you have together and what’s important, and it can make the little things seem very small,” Paulson said.</p><p>“It puts kind of a sharp light mixed with a sort of diffused light on something. … I can’t say it any other way than there’s a poignancy to it, and a heightened sense of time and the value of time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear the couple are extremely happy and seem made for one another, held by fans as LGBTQ icons in Hollywood, despite the age gap that has left some feeling a little uncomfortable.</p><p>But despite their age gap, the candid and beautiful way in which Paulson and Taylor respect one another and talk about their relationship makes them an inspiration to love openly and honestly.
