This time around, Johnny would strike gold.</p><p>Along with <a href=#>Spike Jonze</a>, Knoxville and Tremaine developed something new, a show instantly recognizable to a generation of MTV viewers — the infamous and controversial series Jackass.</p><p>Jackass was a reality comedy series, based on the crazy stunts and mischief of nine friends: <a href=#>Bam Margera</a>, <a href=#>the late Ryan Dunn</a>, <a href=#>Steve-O</a>, Jason "Wee Man" Acuña, <a href=#>Dave England</a>, <a href=#>Ehren McGhehey</a>, <a href=#>Chris Pontius</a>, <a href=#>Preston Lacy</a>, and their de facto leader, Johnny Knoxville:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Jackass crew conducted outlandish stunts and pranks, and they were all so skillful that the show was an instant success, making them superstars overnight.</p><p>Although the Jackass series wrapped after three years, by that time, Johnny Knoxville was in demand, thoroughly enjoying the fame and fortune he'd dreamed of 13 years prior.</p><p>Jackass was over, but the public was definitively not "over" Jackass' wild (and often dangerous) stunts — so the Jackass cast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to make a movie</a>.</p><p>In 2002, Jackass: The Movie was released, and audiences welcomed this film with open arms. On a scant $5 million budget, Jackass: The Movie grossed $79.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In other words, a 20 times over profit meant Jackass was a big franchise, and its newly minted stars did everything in their power to make it even bigger.</p><p>They made spinoffs and sequels of the movies, and launched games. They also sold unreleased material, created live blogs and websites containing stunts, and sold merchandise.</p><p>Jackass was the key to Johnny Knoxville's entrance into the mainstream movie sphere, launching him into a new journey.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Johnny Knoxville still had yet to land a significant role in a major film.</p><p>However, 2002 was the year that changed Knoxville's life.</p><p>Prior to his breakthrough in 2002, Johnny's acting projects consisted of short roles and brief video appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after the huge success of Jackass in 2002, in a single year, he worked on Big Trouble and Men In Black 2 as a major character, and scored a minor role in Wild Deuces.</p><p>Knoxville wanted to prove his mettle as an actor from the beginning, and he was finally making his dreams come true.</p><p>He showcased his acting skills in several great movies, like Grand Theft Parsons, Walking Tall, The Ringer, The Last Stand, Bad Grandpa, Elvis & Nixon, and Above Suspicion.</p><p>Throughout his acting career, Knoxville tackled nearly every kind of role: serious roles, comedy roles, voice acting, stunts, and background actor.</p><p>There are 55 major acting and voice acting projects to his credit, as well as 29 producer credits, and 16 projects on which he wrote.</p><p>A new trailer for an upcoming film starring Knoxville, Sweet Dreams, just dropped on March 13th:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong
