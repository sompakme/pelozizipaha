It was good to see Jen meet a guy who enjoyed “Just Jen” after last week’s court case left her feeling dejected when her dates said they preferred her She-Hulk persona.</p><p>In a quick review of Episode 6, we introduce you to Josh and identify the guy who portrays him, Trevor Salter.</p><p>In episode 6, Nikki and Mallory played Mr. Immortal, a character who often pretended to die, and the evil character searching for She-blood Hulk’s seemed to be the Hulk King.</p><p>She-Hulk is an Attorney at Law, a Disney+ original series based on the same-named Marvel Comics character and starring Tatiana Maslany, Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamil, Tim Roth, and others, charts Jennifer Walters’ evolution into the green superhero.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-she-hulk-actor-trevor-salter-filipino></span>Is She Hulk Actor Trevor Salter Filipino?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With only five acting credits under his belt, Filipino actor Trevor Salter is a relative newcomer to the scene.</p><p>After making his acting debut in the 2015 film Ricki and the Flash, Salter went on to play Officer Santos in Blue Bloods and She-Hulk.</p><p>Since Salter is only listed as appearing in one episode of the Disney Plus series, it’s possible that his character won’t make another appearance.&nbsp;In the upcoming short film Meadow Brook, the actor plays Kyle with a different character.</p><p>However, there is a lot of mystery that surrounds the new actor. There is not much information about the actor in the media and online and he has done a great job keeping his private life to himself.</p><p>With his rising fame and growing fanbase, his fans are dying to know more about his personal life outside of the show, but the actor is very private about what he shares with his fans. He has also not opened up about any information related to his parents. However, we do know that he comes from an American and Asian background.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-josh-from-she-hulks-wedding-party></span>Who is Josh from She-Hulk’s Wedding Party?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We first meet Josh in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law’s Season 1 Episode 6, who is Jennifer Walters’ first love interest without a passion for her enormous, green alter ego. He also makes our Filipino senses tingle.</p><p>In the recently released Episode 7, Josh has even more screen time, and after more inquiry which is stalking, we were able to establish that Trevor Salter, the actor who plays Josh.</p><p>The attraction between Jen and Josh was undeniably there before they were forced to cater themselves.&nbsp;Josh and Jen shared another intimate encounter after the former had drunk a significant amount of alcohol, and they both seemed interested in one another—especially when Josh saw Shulki defeat Titania a second time.</p><p>The Asian-American actor has a limited résumé, but to date, he has appeared in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law as the alleged “good guy” love interest, a 2022 episode of Blue Blood as Officer Santos, and the 2015 film Ricki and the Flash starring Merryl Streep.</p><p>Without a question, the Disney+ series is the most high-profile project he has been associated with. According to Episode 7’s conclusion (no spoilers here), Josh will have a greater part in the next two episodes of the season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-josh-miller-related-to-the-hulk-king></span>How Is Josh Miller Related To The Hulk King?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The opening scene of Episode 7 “The Retreat” is a recap of Episode 6 “Just Jen,” which begins with Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) getting ready to go out with her new lover, Josh Miller, who made an appearance at the wedding in Episode 6.</p><p>Jen received a call on Sunday while she was napping informing her that Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) had been granted parole by the court. She introduced herself to Blonsky, inquired about his state, and forbade him from transforming into the Abomination. Blonsky attempted to accompany Jennifer outside. Swashbuckler and Man-Bull engaged in a sudden fight, during which Jennifer’s automobile sustained damage.</p><p>Jennifer was given a tour of Blonsky’s training and meditation facility. At that spot, her phone signal disappeared. Jennifer observed the individual who attempted to draw his blood there in episode 4.</p><p>He expressed regret to Jennifer. Jennifer is prompted by Blonsky to share certain details about her private life. She claimed to have met Josh Miller during the wedding, but he was no longer returning her calls. Josh unexpectedly sent her a message, which led her to believe that he was in trouble.</p><p>Jennifer already feels terrible about losing her new boyfriend. She worries about getting turned down. Everybody enjoys She-Hulk, but in order to make Jennifer happy, one must pay attention to her. Finally having a team, Jennifer began to treat them like group members.</p><p>In the end, Josh Miller had taken She-blood Hulk’s samples three days earlier when they were having intercourse and sent an emoji to a chat room named “Hulk-King.” So fans suspect that Josh might be working for Hulk King.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsCpsYyhrKWjXZawtbvRZqurnaakv26%2FwKWrnqpdm7attc%2BipahlmJ7AbrrAraCoppGhtrXFjJ%2BYpqGcrnqpu9ZmoKxlmqTAqXnMoqOlnaJiv6a4wK2cnWWkpHq1tMRmn66km2K4qrrGZmlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rod-wave-and-net-worth-how-much-is-wave-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rod Wave and Net Worth  How Much is Wave Worth?">&larr;
