However, there are loads of actors who will never be followed everywhere by the paparazzi even though film and TV fans all over the world adore them. For example, Steve Buscemi is one of the most beloved character actors of all time but everyone knows he will never be a matinee idol. In fact, Buscemi has said that he believes he would never work again if he got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his crooked teeth fixed</a> since that wouldn’t fit his image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Coolidge has never been the kind of actor to headline a blockbuster film. However, since Coolidge has been so delightful in a wide range of projects, she has millions of fans who can’t help but smile when they see her onscreen. Sadly, since Coolidge isn’t a megastar, a lot of her fans have lost track of what she has been up to and they have no idea how much money she has accumulated during her impressive career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Steve Buscemi's Private Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claim-to-fame>Claim To Fame</h2><p>After landing a slew of different roles in movies and TV shows during the mid to late-90s, Jennifer Coolidge’s career really began to take off in 1999. Cast as Stifler’s mom in the surprise hit film American Pie, Coolidge only appeared in a single scene. Despite that, Sitlfer’s mom was such an unforgettable character and Coolidge’s performance was so outstanding that she made a huge impression on most people who saw the film. That was a truly impressive feat since American Pie boasted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a large cast</a> of very talented performers.</p><p>In the years that followed the release of American Pie, Jennifer Coolidge landed several roles that helped to make her an even bigger star. For example, a lot of people still know Coolidge best for her portrayal of a supporting character in the hit film Legally Blonde. Coolidge also notably landed a role in Christopher Guest’s mockumentary Best in Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the rest of the 2000s, Jennifer Coolidge would show up in several films including sequels to her previous movies like American Pie 2 and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde. On top of those films, Coolidge also played memorable roles in two more Christopher Guest mockumentaries, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Less Than Flattering Photos Of The American Pie Cast</a></span></p><h2 id=continuing-to-work>Continuing To Work</h2><p>In the years since the height of Jennifer Coolidge’s fame, she has continued to work consistently. However, one major difference for Coolidge is that most of the projects that Coolidge has been a part of came and went without much fanfare. For example, from 2010 until now, Coolidge took recurring or starring roles in shows like Hero Factory, Fish Hooks, The Fungies!, and The Loud House. If you’ve never heard of any of those series, you aren’t the only one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, it would be a mistake to think that Jennifer Coolidge hasn’t been a part of any hit projects over the last several years. For example, from 2012 until 2017, Coolidge was a big part of the popular sitcom 2 Broke Girls and from 2012 until 2016 she voiced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a character</a> who appeared in 15 episodes of Gravity Falls.</p><p>On the movie-side of things, Jennifer Coolidge’s most recent success was the supporting role that she played in Promising Young Woman. Considering that Coolidge is best known for her comedic chops, it was really interesting to see her in such a dramatic film. Fortunately for everyone involved in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">critically acclaimed</a> movie, Coolidge was great in Promising Young Woman, even though her character didn’t get much screen time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Promising Young Woman': Carey Mulligan’s Mom Nailed Her Pre-Oscars Gift</a></span></p><h2 id=laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank>Laughing All The Way To The Bank</h2><p>Since Jennifer Coolidge has never been the kind of movie star whose salaries are so outrageous that they garner headlines, most of her fans likely have no idea how rich she might be. Sure, she has worked consistently in Hollywood for many years now but since Coolidge almost always portrays supporting characters, some of her fans may think that she hasn’t cashed in. As it turns out, however, Coolidge has the kind of money that most people can only dream of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it should go without saying that there is no way to know for sure how much money Jennifer Coolidge is worth. That said, there are websites and magazines that track down every piece of information they can be found about famous actor's salaries, their expenses, and their assets. After putting together that information, they are able to put together a reasonably accurate estimate of the star’s net worth. For example, according to celebritynetworth.com, Jennifer Coolidge has an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$8 million</a> net worth. Considering how talented Coolidge is, that is great to know.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jennifer Coolidge Did This Hilarious Thing So She Could Date Two Men</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbEp6WinpWneqS7zqWgnZ%2BVYq6vsIyhprBlnaqwqXnIrGSsoJVixLC%2B06FkraeUlsZw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-baller-wife-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Baller: Wife, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts">&larr;
